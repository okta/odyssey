### Making a commit

Odyssey uses the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
standard for formating commit messages. After you commit work locally with
`git` your commit message wil be linted to ensure it adheres to the
configuration setup within the `@okta/odyssey-commitlint` package.
In case of emergencies, break the glass and use an invalid commit message
by providing the `--no-verify` flag to `git commit`.
