## Form Field Accessibility

### Placeholders

Except for Search inputs, we advise against using placeholder text for inputs.

#### Translation

To prevent triggering a change in page layout, browsers don't translate certain attributes. Because of this, users will see untranslated placeholder text.

#### Recall

Placeholder text disappears when a field is interacted with. For this reason, it's not suitable for formatting guidelines or necessary context.

#### Utility

Placeholder content is limited to static text. Additionally, placeholder text is truncated beyond the width of its input.

#### Field value confusion

Low-contrast placeholders may be illegible for some users. Yet, placeholders with compliant contrast can be mistaken for field values. High Contrast Mode will make placeholders and values appear identical.

Finally, Users with low digital literacy may not understand the purpose or behavior of placeholder text.

### Purpose

When collecting an individual's personal data, you must define the input's purpose via the `autocomplete` attribute. This allows users to automate the filling of fields and ensures the purpose is known, regardless of the label. A complete list of fields this is required for may be found <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes">in the WCAG spec</a>.

### Autofocus

Except for very specific cases, we advise against using the `autoFocus` prop; unless used considerately, the sense of focus being "teleported" to an unexpected part of the page can be jarring to users, especially those using screen readers.

More details can be found [on MDN's `autofocus` page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus#accessibility_considerations).
