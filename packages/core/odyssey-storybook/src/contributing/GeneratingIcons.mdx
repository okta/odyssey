# Generating Odyssey Icons

## tl;dr

1. Designer exports all icons as SVGs.
2. Put icons in `packages/odyssey-icons/figma`.
3. Run `yarn generate:icons` from the project root.
4. Add new icons to `packages/core/odyssey-react-mui/icons/index.ts`.

## Verbose

When we have new icons in Figma, a designer will add those to the `packages/odyssey-icons` package in the `figma/` folder.

After that's complete, run this command to generate our icons:

```sh
yarn generate:icons
```

After icons are generated, there's one manual step required. Any new icons need to be manually added to the `odyssey-react-mui/icons/index.ts` file. Just copy paste an existing icon export and modify it.

In the past, this was automated, but an update to the SVGR library broke index templating, so we have to do this part by hand.
