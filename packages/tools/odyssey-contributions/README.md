# Official UI Core Odyssey Contributions Library Stack

This is the _official_ "Odyssey Contributions" development stack for _component_ libraries supported by the UI Core & Odyssey teams.

A Component Library (vs. a pure library) is one that provides components based on the UI framework (e.g. React components, providers, etc.). For the `odyssey-contributions` stack, this implies having React as a dependency and needing JSX-related configs for linting, testing, and building.

See documentation in `@okta/ok-ui` CLI for adoption information.
