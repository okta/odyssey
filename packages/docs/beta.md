## TODO

(Placing content here to be moved to wherever perm home is. My thinking was Updates, but no strong opinions as long as it's accessible within the Docs. - shred)

## The road to 1.0

<Description>

Odyssey is currently in Beta. This can mean different things for different teams, so we'd like to offer some clarity.

While the design system is in Beta, our standards remain high. The Odyssey team is dedicated to research-backed, accessible UI. Rest assured that Beta status doesn't change that.

Change itself, however, should be expected.

### Why Beta?

<Description>

There are two main reasons we regard Odyssey as a product in Beta.

First, Odyssey has not been tested, end-to-end, on enough platforms. We like to believe our UI is strong enough to support the needs of Okta and our customers, but that belief has not been validated. Indeed, there are known gaps! In this way, the Beta flag is an acknowledgement that we know your needs may not be met yet.

Second, our foundations are still emerging. Whether it's visual foundations or technical architecture, the most basic structures of the system are being actively tested and rewritten. You should always expect improvement from Odyssey. Beta is a period where most improvements may introduce breaking changes.

### What does this mean for me?

<Description>

*Designers,* the UI Kit and guidelines you are presented with today have been vetted by our team. You should feel safe using them to design features as long as you are comfortable with change. Radical changes may occur, but they will not be implemented without consideration and communication.

*Engineers,* the `@okta/odyssey` package will see major changes between now and 1.0. These resources we deliver are ready for early adopters, but breaking changes should be expected.
