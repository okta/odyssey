## Knowledgeable

Okta is a technical product. It’s the role of Design to simplify unfamiliar and complex concepts. Ask questions, verify assumptions, dig into the needs and goals. Only once you understand the problem deeply can you solve it effectively.

## Clear

Our job is to eliminate ambiguity. We empower users to move forward with confidence, knowing what will happen next and why. Our designs should be clear over clever, digestible over exhaustive.

## Cohesive

A person’s experience with Okta may be broad and each touchpoint should feel like part of one Okta. Make use of existing patterns, only deviating when the benefits outweigh the costs. Consider dependencies, downstream effects, and the larger implications of our work to create a thoughtful, cohesive experience for our users.

## Human

While some who use Okta are highly technical, many are not. But all are human. Be approachable and accessible—in both our visual design and our language. Be compelling. Demonstrate the value of Okta in human, real-world terms.
