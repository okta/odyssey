## Knowledgeable

Okta is a technical product. Itâ€™s the role of Design to simplify unfamiliar and complex concepts. Ask questions, verify assumptions, dig into the needs and goals. Only once you understand the problem deeply can you solve it effectively.

ðŸ’¡ Helpful questions to ask:

- Has my team articulated the business goals and the needs of the user or audience? Are we all aligned?
- Do I have enough domain knowledge and information to make decisions with confidence and back them up with the broader team?
- Do I understand the constraints (technical, budget, time)?

## Clear

Our job is to eliminate ambiguity. We empower users to move forward with confidence, knowing what will happen next and why. Our designs should be clear over clever, digestible over exhaustive.

ðŸ’¡ Helpful questions to ask:

- How might the words or images Iâ€™ve used be interpreted differently than I intended? Can I eliminate confusion?
- What is the one thing people must take away from my work? Are they able to do that without unnecessary friction?
- Can I edit or break up content to make it more digestible?
- Have I eliminated any words that add critical context?

## Cohesive

A personâ€™s experience with Okta may be broad and each touchpoint should feel like part of one Okta. Make use of existing patterns, only deviating when the benefits outweigh the costs. Consider dependencies, downstream effects, and the larger implications of our work to create a thoughtful, cohesive experience for our users.

ðŸ’¡ Helpful questions to ask:

- What existing patterns, messaging, visuals, terminology, etc. can I reuse or build upon for my work?
- If Iâ€™m designing something new, what are the risks and benefits? Can this new element be reused in the future?
- What expectations might I be setting in my work that will need to be met in other areas of the experience? How can I collaborate with the necessary teams to ensure a smooth customer experience?

## Human

While some who use Okta are highly technical, many are not. But all are human. Be approachable and accessibleâ€”in both our visual design and our language. Be compelling. Demonstrate the value of Okta in human, real-world terms.

ðŸ’¡ Helpful questions to ask:

- How can the practice of storytelling and crafting a narrative improve my work?
- Am I using technical jargon that can be translated to more common or friendly language? Do I explain acronyms?
- Can I do more to frame my work in terms of day-to-day, real world problems? What more can I do to demonstrate the value of Okta in a relatable way?
