# Odyssey - the Okta design system

Hello and welcome! These are the early days of Okta's design system, and things will be in flux for a while. Feel free to poke around, test things out, and explore our guidelines.

## Contributing

### Grab All the Things

These docs are maintained in the `docs` package, which exists to document `@okta/odyssey`.

1. You'll need the `odyssey` repo.

    ```bash
    [okta]$ git clone git@github.com:okta/odyssey.git
    ```

2. Make sure you are on a supported node version: `>=12.13.0`.

3. Change directory to the `docs` package.

    ```bash
    [okta]$ cd odyssey/packages/docs
    ```

4. Run a [yarn install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/install)

    ```bash
    [okta/odyssey/packages/docs]$ yarn install
    ```

You may need to [install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) if it's not available.

### Serving the Docs

1. Start up Hexo:

    ```bash
     [okta/odyssey/packages/docs]$ yarn start
    ```

    This will generate a fresh set of docs and then start a webserver to view them.

2. Go to <http://localhost:4000/>

### Odyssey Development

In order to see your changes to the `@okta/odyssey` package reflected here during development, you'll need to link that package locally.

1. Change directory to the `@okta/odyssey` package.

    ```bash
    [okta/odyssey]$ cd packages/odyssey
    ```

2. Create a yarn link.

    ```bash
    [okta/odyssey/packages/odyssey]$ yarn link
    ```

3. Change directory to the `docs` package.

    ```bash
    [okta/odyssey/packages/odyssey]$ cd ../docs
    ```

4. Tell `yarn` to utilize the linked package instead of the published one.

    ```bash
    [okta/odyssey/packages/docs]$ yarn link @okta/odyssey
    ```

Now any changes you make in your local version of `@okta/odyssey` should be reflected in your local server.
