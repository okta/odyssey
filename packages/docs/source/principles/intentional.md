# Intentional

## Definition

* Done with care and attention to craft.
* Is deliberate. Understands the options and their pros/cons/risks and has chosen one.
* Takes a stance or voices an expert opinion to guide its audience.

## Examples

* Research
  * Our research is always goals-based. We research to validate assumptions and assess risks.
* Creative
  * Icon grid ensures that all icons, regardless of proportions, appear to be the same size.

* Product
  * Policies have a zero state for your base policy to clearly explain what it does and why it's there. That way users don't have to try to parse it and guess about why it can't be removed.

  * Registration separates credential fields from other fields. We think they should always be first, and we know that they have a different purpose from other fields you may want to use on a registration form.

  * Mappings force you to map one mapping at a time and automatically test for you. (This was done to reduce errors caused by mapping many attributes at once without testing.)
