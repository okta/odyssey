# Intentional UI friction

In general we strive to make our UI as efficient and easy-to-use as possible. However, there are times when intentional inefficiency helps our users.

## Reasons

Some reasons to introduce intentional friction:
* Prevent high risk actions from accidentally happening.
* Make sure a user knows the impact of their actions before acting.

## Strategies

Some ways that we introduce intential friction
* Pop ups, notifications, warnings
* Require multiple interactions to signal intent (e.g. click then swipe, type name of thing to be deleted before you can click the "delete" button)
* Hide parts of the UI and require a click to view them (e.g. advanced settings)
* Instruct a user to do an additional step, but don't take them to it
