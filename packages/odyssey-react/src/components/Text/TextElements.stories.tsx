### Accessibility

Many screen readers do not let users know of the presence of &lt;del&gt;. To fix this, you should consider using **a11yStart** and **a11yEnd** props to 
prepend and append assistive text to the contents of the tag. In the above example, there are additional spaces before and after the text,
this is intentional. Not adding these spaces will cause the content within the tag to run into the text within the tag.`,
