# @okta/odyssey-react

This project has not yet hit version 1.0.0 and is still in active development.

That said, it is beyond the early alpha stage in some key areas. For some
early-adopters that means it is good enough to use for real things. Some
other people think this means odyssey-react is not ready yet.

Even though odyssey-react's version is not yet 1.0.0, effort is still made
to keep the API stable. Patch versions are intended for backwards-compatible
changes and minor versions are intended for backwards-incompatible changes.

If you plan to use odyssey-react for something real, you should either pin
the exact version (maximum safety) or pin the major and minor versions
(only accept backwards-compatible upgrades).
