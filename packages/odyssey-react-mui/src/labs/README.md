## Production Readiness

Odyssey is production-ready and available to use for real things. The API
is stable for the duration of the point-release, meaning that while Odyssey is
in version 1.x.x, there will be no changes that break the API.

**Odyssey Labs** is the home for components that are usable, but not feature-complete.
At minimum, they'll provide a good jumping-off point for your project; however, they
are not guaranteed to have full support for the full suite of things that Odyssey
provides, such as RTL support, internationalization, etc.

This project follows semantic versioning conventions:

- **Major point releases** may include breaking changes, but the API is stable for the duration of
  the major point release (for example, 1.x.x)
- **Minor point releases** include new features and are backwards-compatible (eg, x.1.x)
- **Patch releases** include bug fixes (eg, x.x.1)

## Getting Started

To use Odyssey Labs, import as:

```sh
import from "@okta/odyssey-react-mui/labs"
```

## Components

Components are published in an ESM format transpiled for the modern browsers
within the [Okta supported browser list][1]. These modules can be served
directly to evergreen browsers for simple applications, or further transpiled,
bundled, and polyfilled for advanced use cases and browser support targets.
