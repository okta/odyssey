# @okta/odyssey-react-mui

## Production Readiness

This project has not yet hit version 1.0.0 and is still in active development.

That said, it is beyond the early alpha stage in some key areas. For some
early-adopters that means it is good enough to use for real things. Some
other people think this means it is not ready yet.

Even though the project is in development, effort is still made to keep
the API stable. Patch versions are intended for backwards-compatible
changes and minor versions are intended for backwards-incompatible changes.

If you plan to use this for something real, you should either pin the
exact version (maximum safety) or pin the major and minor versions
(only accept backwards-compatible upgrades).

## Getting Started

Install the package and peer dependencies:

```sh
yarn add @okta/odyssey-react-mui @emotion/react
```

Include fonts:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" />
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Public+Sans:ital,wght@0,400;0,600;1,400;1,600&display=swap"
/>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inconsolata&display=swap"
/>
```

Import named ESM exports:

```js
import { PasswordInput } from "@okta/odyssey-react-mui";
```

Add the Odyssey `OdysseyProvider` around your whole app:

```jsx
import { OdysseyProvider } from "@okta/odyssey-react-mui";

const YourAppRoot = ({ children }) => (
  <OdysseyProvider>{children}</OdysseyProvider>
);
```

Add Material-UI components not exported from Odyssey with Odyssey styling or add your own theme to MUI:

```sh
$ yarn add @mui/material
```

```jsx
import { OdysseyThemeProvider } from "@okta/odyssey-react-mui";

import { myMaterialUiTheme } from "./myMaterialUiTheme";

const YourAppRoot = ({ children }) => (
  <OdysseyThemeProvider theme={myMaterialUiTheme}>{children}<OdysseyThemeProvider>
);
```

### Upgrade Piecemeal

Itâ€™s possible to have 2 versions of Odyssey running at the same time, so when adding MUI, you can do it piecemeal.

This is how you setup two `OdysseyProvider`s like so:

```jsx
import { OdysseyProvider } from "@okta/odyssey-react-mui";
import { ThemeProvider as OdysseyLegacyThemeProvider } from "@okta/odyssey-react-theme";

const YourAppRoot = ({ children }) => (
  <OdysseyProvider>
    <OdysseyLegacyThemeProvider>{children}</OdysseyLegacyThemeProvider>
  </OdysseyProvider>
);
```

### Overrides

It is possible to provide `nonce`, `themeOverride`, `languageCode` and `translationOverrides` to the underlying components via props:

```jsx
import { OdysseyProvider } from "@okta/odyssey-react-mui";
import { theme } from "./themeOverride";

const nonce =
  "K6ybeaqlwaAKk0hQF?hE2qZ0Ar3M=G4Bpr-XFk1x4XbL3dH3T5=mk0aXeWX9ifn9";

const languageCode = "en";

const translationOverrides = {
  en: {
    "fieldlabel.optional.text": "Not Required",
  },
  fr: {
    "fieldlabel.optional.text": "Non Requis",
  },
};

const YourAppRoot = ({ children }) => (
  <OdysseyProvider
    nonce={nonce}
    themeOverride={theme}
    languageCode={languageCode}
    translationOverrides={translationOverrides}
  >
    {children}
  </OdysseyProvider>
);
```

## Components

Components are published in an ESM format transpiled for the modern browsers
within the [Okta supported browser list][1]. These modules can be served
directly to evergreen browsers for simple applications, or further transpiled,
bundled, and polyfilled for advanced use cases and browser support targets.
