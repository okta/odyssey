# Getting Started

Thanks for supporting Odyssey. This is the Quick Start guide you should read first.

## Requirements

### Husky Config

Please add this to `~/.huskyrc` to use Odyssey with Git tooling such as GitKraken:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
source ~/.zshrc

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

if test -f ".nvmrc"; then
  nvm use
fi
```

In this case, the config is referencing the `~/.zshrc` file. If you're using bash, then reference `~/.bashrc` instead.
