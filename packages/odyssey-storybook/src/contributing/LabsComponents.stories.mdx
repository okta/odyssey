# Contibuting Odyssey Labs Components

If you are wanting to add components to Odyssey Labs, read this doc first before creating a PR.

## Requirements

Getting components added to Odyssey requires a few steps to be completed first:

1. Get approval from Odyssey design to see if that component even belongs in Odyssey.
2. The component should be generic enough to allow reuse by all teams at Okta.
3. Re-export or wrap your custom component, and provide Storybook documentation.
4. If necessary, create a custom `ThemeProvider` specific to your component.

## Approval

We only want components going into Odyssey that will eventually be pulled into Odyssey proper. That means design has to check off on your component's inclusion before we add it to labs.

## Generic Component Design

This is a tough thing to approve, but components need their props and design not tightly-coupled to a single project at Okta. To avoid this, we need to build them with reuse in mind.

If you're unsure, get architectural feedback from engineers on Odyssey. In general, it's always good check with a team's engineers before introducing code into another project.

## Documentation

All components in Labs need Storybook documentation. While it may seem redundant, Odyssey engineers need to eventually pull that code into Odyssey, and having documentation about the intended use cases will be very helpful even for component re-exports.

When we need to wrap one or more components documentation is even more crucial to understanding how this is supposed to work for all engineers at Okta. Be as detailed as you can to make it as easy for anyone to understand.

## Custom `ThemeProvider`s

Why do we have a custom `ThemeProvider` for each Labs component?

That's because each component needs to be custom-themed. Sometimes, components will have all the right themeing straight out of Odyssey, but other times, we need to customize those styles.

Rather than building in the component-specific `ThemeProvider` into a wrapped version of the component itself, we're exporting the `ThemeProvider` component separately to allow its removal when customized styles are necessary. This provides a bit of boilerplate for each labs component but ensures consumers aren't locked-in to the theming set in labs.
