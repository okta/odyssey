# Documentation

In order to be considered for release, components require documentation. We provide a template for component documentation to make this process easier and ensure consistent docs.

## Doc style

When writing documentation, adhere to the following guidelines to help ensure consistency:

- Use markdown/Storybook tables unless you're specifically documenting a use of Table
- Write separate CSF stories for optional component parts
- Use inline MDX stories when showcasing appropriate content or "don't" examples
- Use exemplary language rather than descriptive language within stories ("Launch" vs "Button label")

## Doc sections

From top to bottom, component documentation should include these sections. Optional content is marked as such.

<dl>
  <dt>Overview</dt>
  <dd>
    This section should be named after the component and include a short
    description as well as links to the Figma files and source code.
  </dd>
  <dt>Anatomy</dt>
  <dd>
    This section houses a figure which provides a visual breakdown of the
    component parts, layout, and tokens.
  </dd>
  <dt>Props</dt>
  <dd>
    This section should be automatically populated by an
    <code>&lt;ArgsTable/&gt;</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt>Behavior (Optional)</dt>
  <dd>
    While Usage section below describes guidelines for designers and engineers,
    Behavior describes default behaviors included with components.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    This section is not required if the component has limited or self-evident
    behavior.
  </dd>
  <dt>Variants (Optional)</dt>
  <dd>
    This section decribes the differing configurations available for the
    component.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    These variants could be global or semantic changes (e.g. "Success" vs
    "Danger") or different component assemblies (e.g. "With actions")
  </dd>
  <dt>States</dt>
  <dd>This section covers all the states a component can find itself in.</dd>
  <dd>
    Pseudo-classed states requiring user interaction, specifically `:focus` and
    `:hover` are not required if those states can be observed via quick user
    interaction.
  </dd>
  <dt>Usage</dt>
  <dd>
    This is where we lay out the function of components and how they can be used
    within a design/view/page.
  </dd>
  <dd>DOs and DONTs are appropriate for this section.</dd>
  <dt>Content Guidelines</dt>
  <dd>
    This is where we lay out any requirements around acceptable content for use
    within the component.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    This includes both what a component may contain as well as how that content
    should be written.
  </dd>
  <dd>DOs and DONTs are appropriate for this section.</dd>
  <dt>Accessibility</dt>
  <dd>
    This section includes any guidelines required for compliance as well as
    design rationale already leveraged to ensure compliance - both "please do
    this" and "we do this because".
  </dd>
  <dt>Responsive Web Design (optional)</dt>
  <dd>Any considerations for use or documentation.</dd>
  <dd>
    This section is rare today, but should include examples and rationale
    similar to the Accessibility section.
  </dd>
  <dt>Globalization (optional)</dt>
  <dd>
    This should include any notes about use or cultural considerations, as well
    as whether the component is lacking globalization support in some regard.
  </dd>
  <dt>References (optional)</dt>
  <dd>
    This section has two optional children: Related Components and Further
    Reading
  </dd>
  <dt>Related Components (optional)</dt>
  <dd>
    Points the user toward any related components, possibly alternate solutions.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    We do this in a few places today and it may be beneficial to include in more
    places.
  </dd>
  <dt>Further Reading (optional)</dt>
  <dd>
    Again, included in some places, always optional, but could provide
    additional rationale or education for our users.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    These have been especially helpful when deviating from common dark patterns
    or legacy solutions.
  </dd>

# Landing Gear

This component provides traction and cushion during take-off and landing.

[Figma](http://figma.com/path/to/my-component) - [Source](http://github.com/okta/odyssey/path/to/source)

## Anatomy

**ANATOMY PLACEHOLDER**

## Props

<ArgsTable/>

## Behavior (optional)

Landing Gear deploys through doors in the heat shield. This component cannot be retracted once deployed.

## Variants (optional)

Odyssey offers both automatic and manual variants of Landing Gear.

### Manual

Since Landing Gear is deployed through the heat shield, our default variant is Manual control. Unless automated systems have a sufficient success rate, please utilize this variant.

### Automatic

Automatic Landing Gear is deployed once the orbiter has achieved a set proximity to the ground. If your atmospheric density is variable, we recommend using Manual deployment instead.

## States (optional)

### Retracted

In its retracted state, Landing Gear is not visible, being stored behind the heat shield.

### Deployed

In its deployed state, Landing Gear emerges from behind the heat shield and becomes visible. Landings are only possible in this state.

## Usage

Landing Gear should be used when designing any craft with air-to-ground capability.

For most crafts, three sets of Landing Gear are necessary and sufficient. If you are working with particularly large or small crafts, please reach out to the Odyssey team.

### Do

- Utilize Landing Gear when terrestial excursions are rare but expected.
- Account for both retracted and deployed states in your designs.

### Don't

- Landing Gear should not be included on any craft that will not make terrestial landings.
- Do not limit your craft to only Deployed or Retracted states. Landing Gear requires both states for full functionality.

## Content Guidelines

When marking left and right Landing Gear controls, treat the nose of your craft as "forward".

Please do not use "port" and "starboard" terminology when referencing controls, as these designations are not useful on some planets.

## Accessibility

Crafts utilizing Landing Gear are required to utilize a nose wheel steering system. Ensure your individual Landing Gear components are associated with the appropriate rudder pedals.

## Responsive Web Design (optional)

As noted above, craft are expected to utilize three sets of Landing Gear. This configuration should scale for both large and small crafts.

If you encounter issues with the configuration, please reach out, as a more fluid design may be required.

## Globalization (optional)

Some systems disallow Automatic variants of Landing Gear, as failures are catastrophic. Ensure your craft designs are in compliance with local mandates.
