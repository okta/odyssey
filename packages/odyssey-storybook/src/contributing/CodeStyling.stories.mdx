# Code Styling Guidelines

## Principles

We define every prop explicitly, rather than extending the full array of MUI props, to ensure that Odyssey components only include the features we’ve explicitly defined.

We derive state from functionality whenever possible.

In MUI, the Chip component includes separate props for clickable and onClick. For Odyssey Tag, we’ve simplified this to only onClick — if onClick is defined, we know the tag is cliackble. If it isn’t defined, we know it isn’t. No need for two separate props.

Booleans are named as isBoolean or hasBoolean, such as isDisabled, isVisible, or hasError. This is different from MUI, which uses the simple boolean name (disabled or visible).

Events are named as onEvent , with the event in present-tense (such as onClick, onRemove, etc)

We use the terms “Delete” and “Remove” differently and deliberately:

We use Delete for an action that makes an object permanently inaccessible, such as deleting data from a database

We use Remove for an action that removes a reference to an object, or for temporary removal, such as removing a tag from a list (assuming the tag is still available to be added to future lists)
