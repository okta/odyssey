# Code Styling Guidelines

## Prop Naming

We define every prop explicitly, rather than extending the full array of MUI props, to ensure that Odyssey components only include the features we’ve explicitly defined.

We derive state from functionality whenever possible.

### Callbacks

All events have an `on` prefix. Events are named as `on[EVENT_NAME]`, with the event in present-tense (such as `onClick`, `onRemove`, etc).

In MUI, the Chip component includes separate props for `clickable` and `onClick`. For Odyssey Tag, we’ve simplified this to only `onClick` — if `onClick` is defined, we know the tag is `cliackble`. If it isn’t defined, we know it isn’t. No need for two separate props.

### Booleans

Booleans are named as `isBoolean` or `hasBoolean`, such as `isDisabled`, `isVisible`, or `hasError`. This is different from MUI, which uses the simple boolean name (`disabled` or `visible`).

### Terminology: Delete versus Remove

We have deliberately different meanings for “Delete” and “Remove”.

We use Delete for an action that makes an object permanently inaccessible, such as deleting data from a database.

We use Remove for an action that removes a reference to an object, or for temporary removal, such as removing a tag from a list (assuming the tag is still available to be added to future lists).
