# Preparing a pull request

[Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) are always welcome, but before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with maintainers.

A good PR is small, focuses on a single feature or improvement, and clearly communicates the problem it solves. Try not to include more than one issue in a single PR. It's much easier for us to review multiple small pull requests than one that is large and unwieldy.

1. Open source contributors should [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

2. Clone the fork to your local machine and add upstream remote:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/odyssey.git
cd odyssey
git remote add upstream https://github.com/atko-eng/odyssey-design-system.git
```

3. Synchronize your local `develop` branch with the upstream remote:

```sh
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
```

4. Oktanauts should clone the repo directly:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/atko-eng/odyssey-design-system.git
```

5. Install dependencies with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```sh
yarn install
```

6. Create a new branch related to your PR:

```sh
git checkout -b initials-my-bug-fix
```

7. Make changes, then commit and push to your remote:

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD
```

8. Go to [the repository](https://github.com/atko-eng/odyssey-design-system) and [make a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

9. Oktanauts should [create an associated JIRA card](https://github.com/atko-eng/odyssey-design-system/issues/new/choose) for any pull requests they open.

10. We will review your Pull Request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.
