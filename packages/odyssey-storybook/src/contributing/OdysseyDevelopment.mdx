# Odyssey development

This is the guide to read if you are cloning Odyssey to your local machine
to build a new feature, refactor, fix bugs, or improve our documentation!

## Node

Odyssey uses the Gallium LTS Node version. Ensure you have the correct
version of `node` installed as well as `yarn` available on your `$PATH`.
You may need to configure your editor, terminal tab, or tmux pane to
the correct version each time:

```sh
# use node node version specified by Odyssey
nvm use

# install yarn client globally for correct node version
npm install --global yarn
```

## Repository structure

The repo is managed via [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces)
and applies a modular approach to code organization where individual
packages are separated for a number of reasons:

- Delineate private vs public code
- Share configuration and behavior easily
- Enforce strong domain boundaries across our dependency graph to allow
  for easier long term maintenance.

## Initial setup

Let's get Odyssey installed on your machine and running locally:

```sh
# clone the git repository
git clone https://github.com/okta/odyssey.git
cd odyssey

# install dependencies, build packages, and install git hooks
yarn install

# start Storybook in the browser
yarn start
```

As you make component javascript or style changes you should see the Storybook
application update in your browser. Keep in mind that some tooling focused
packages in our repo are not watched to trigger automatic dev server reloads.

If you're working on a tooling package make sure to focus on unit coverage
first and then integration testing with the Storybook environment second.

### Development commands

```sh
# Build all packages (use after rebasing/changing branches/etc)
yarn build

# Lint all packages
yarn lint
```

## Testing your code

We strongly suggest writing or modifying tests to support any changes you make.
You can then run `yarn test` to ensure the test suite continues to pass.

## Committing to git

When making a commit, your commit title should be formatted to include
meaningful, machine parseable meta-data about your work. Odyssey uses the
[conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) standard for
this purpose.

The scope of your commit, while optional, should only include the particular
package changed in your work. When operating on multiple packages, break
the work into smaller commits with correct scopes for each.

The title of your commmit should reflect the nature of the change. A `feat`
title for example would denote work that adds a new feature to the project.
A `chore` title is exactly that, work that is not worthy of mention to
a public audience and contains no breaking changes.

If you are iterating within your feature branch prior to merge use commit
titles intended for downstream developers who would be reviewing a CHANGELOG
file, considering an upgrade to a future release of one or more `@okta/odyssey-*`
packages for their own project.

For example, if you need to make changes based in your branch based on
some code review feedback, avoid titling your commit `fix: respond to PR feedback`
instead squash your changes together using an interactive rebase or use
an innocuous commit title: `chore(odyssey-react-mui): respond to PR feedback`
which will not appear within any generated CHANGELOG files at release time.

If you are unsure of your commit structure, run `yarn commitlint` to
ensure your latest commit adheres to conventional commit standard.

## Building for accessibility

As a highlevel guide, please consult the full [Dequeue Web Accessibility Checklist](https://dequeuniversity.com/checklists/web).

Beyond the checklist, Odyssey uses DOM based assertions in our test suite,
static analysis of our component code at authorship time, and snapshot based
contrast ratio assertions in CI to further automate good a11y outcomes.

## Icon management

Updating or adding icons is currently a simple but manual process:

1. [Design] Export the SVG from Figma with default settings.
2. [Engineering] Copy this SVG into `packages/odyssey-icons/figma/`.

- This is where our unoptimized icon assets are housed.

3. [Engineering] From `packages/odyssey-icons/` run `yarn svgo`.

- This updates all unoptimized assets based on the latest `packages/odyssey-icons/.svgo.yml` and copies them to `packages/odyssey-icons/src/`.

4. [Engineering] From `packages/odyssey-react-mui` run `yarn build:icons`.

- This generates `<XIcon>` components for all optimized assets in `packages/odyssey-icons/src/`.

5. [Engineering] Update `packages/odyssey-storybook/src/components/odyssey-mui/Icon/Icon.stories.tsx` to include this new icon.

- `name` should match the asset's filename; `use` is optional--ask Design if you're unsure.

If these steps have completed successfully, the new asset should be visible in [the Icon Library](?path=/docs/mui-components-icon--library#library).
