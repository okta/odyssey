# Custom Theme

A way to use custom theme to override odyssey default theme.

## Behavior

Visually, the mui components under `OdysseyThemeProvider` with custom theme would consume that theme.

### Button Primary

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.ButtonStory} />
</Canvas>

### Input

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.TextFieldStory} />
</Canvas>

### Radio

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.RadioGroupStory} />
</Canvas>

### Customizming MUI Components

Overriding the theme of MUI component directly that is not part of odyssey.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="customization-components--custom-component-story" />
</Canvas>
