# Utilities

## Box VS Text

In production docs, these sections will live with their appropriate utility. I've co-located them here, so that we can align internally.

### Box


### Text

**WIP API NOTE:** Would anyone be opposed to renaming this component to `<StyledElement>` or similar?

`<Text />` is a convenience utility built with `<Box />`. It can provide its own hooks for customization and theme-able tokens as necessary.

#### Styled element insertion

`<Text />` enables authors and components to insert styled HTML5 elements without the need for a global CSS sheet.

```jsx
We <Text as="em">really</Text> need to get off this planet.
```

A more complicated example might look like this:

```jsx
<Text as="blockquote">
  <Text as="p">
    The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason
    for existence.
  </Text>
  <footer>
    Albert Einstein,
    <Text as="cite">
      Old Man's Advice to Youth: "Never Lose a Holy Curiosity," LIFE magazine (2
      May 1955) statement to William Miller, p. 64.
    </Text>
  </footer>
</Text>
```

####

**WIP API NOTE:** This next section is an additional use-case for `<Text />`.

In addition, `<Text />` provides a simpler API with indirect descendant selectors for natural HTML5 composition or styling dynamic content (e.g. from markdown).

```jsx
<Text>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own
      reason for existence.
    </p>
    <footer>
      Albert Einstein,
      <cite>
        Old Man's Advice to Youth: "Never Lose a Holy Curiosity," LIFE magazine
        (2 May 1955) statement to William Miller, p. 64.
      </cite>
    </footer>
  </blockquote>
</Text>
```

## Current Cases

Currently, we have a few open PRs that stand as practical examples for application of these utilities. Below, I've outlined my current understanding of what each component should look like, given these utilities.

### Field

```jsx
// Field

<Box as={tag} className={styles.root}>
  <Field.Label
    inputId={inputId}
    required={required}
    optionalLabel={optionalLabel}
    labelHidden={labelHidden}
    as={TagLabel}
  >
    {label}
  </Field.Label>
  {hint && <Field.Hint id={inputId}>{hint}</Field.Hint>} {children} {error &&
  <Field.Error id={inputId}>{error}</Field.Error>}
</Box>

// Label //// In the case of these label elements, we can treat our Field
styling as the HTML5 default, removing the need for component-specific styling.

<Text as={labelTag} htmlFor={inputId}>
  {children} {!required && optionalLabel && (
  <span className={styles.optionalLabel} children={optionalLabel} />
  )}
</Text>

// Hidden Label

<ScreenReaderText>
  <Text as={labelTag} htmlFor={inputId}>
    {children} {!required && optionalLabel && (
    <span className={styles.optionalLabel} children={optionalLabel} />
    )}
  </Text>
</ScreenReaderText>

// Hint

<Box
  as="p"
  className={styles.hint}
  id={`${id}-hint`}
  children={children}
/>

// Error

<Box as="p" className={styles.error} id={`${id}-error`}>{children} /> </Box>
```

### Heading

Much like `<Text />` is a convenience wrapper on top of `<Box />`, `<Heading />` is built on `<Text />`.

```jsx
// Heading

<Text as={tag} className={componentClass}>
  {children}
</Text>
```

My assumption here is that all Headings have parity with our desired HTML5 defaults. The `className` would be used to apply a different level of visual hierarchy to a tag (an `h1` with the styles of an `h3`).

If a component requires heading styling that deviates farther than that, those styles should live with the component until they become a pattern.

### List

```jsx
// List

<Box as={tag}> { children } </Box>

//// `tag` here would be ul, ol, dl // ListItem

<Text as={childTag}> { children } </Text>
```

If `<List>` were only intended to be used in the fashion of plain HTML5, `<Text>` could probably be used throughout. e.g. `<Text as="ul">`. However, we've seen that `<List>` is likely to have more complicated functionality.

Alternately, using `<Text as="ul">` could provide default styling while `<List>` comes without assumed margins and padding.
