- `MenuButton`
- `Radio`
- `RadioGroup`

### Component API

**All components are now being wrapped and many prop names have changed. Prop names and APIs will now be more consistent across Odyssey.**

### Deprecations

1. `InputAdornment` is no longer erquired for `startAdronment` and `endAdornment` on `TextField`.
1. `InputBase` should be replaced with `TextField`.
1. The `size` prop on `Icon` is now required.

## `v0.17.x` ➡️ `v0.21.x`

### New Components

- `Banner`
- `Checkbox`
- `CheckboxGroup`
- `Chip`
- `DatePicker` (Labs)
- `Callout`
- `ListSubheader`
- `Radio`
- `RadioGroup`
- `ScopedCssBaseline`
- `ScreenReaderText`
- `Status`
- `TextField`

### Components with Props Changes

- `Checkbox`
- `Radio`
- `RadioGroup`

### Component API

1. Many new components have been added and wrapped; although, prop names in these versions are not necessarily following Odyssey guidelines.
1. MUI-passthrough is still allowed even for wrapped components. This will change in later versions.

### Deprecations

1. `InputBase` should be replaced with `TextField`.
1. `InputLabel` should not be used. We build it into our field components and created an internal `Field` component to ensure matching styles. If you have custom field components that we don't support, message in `#odyssey` to see if we should add your field or expose `Field`.

## `v0.14.x` ➡️ `0.17.x`

### Importing from Odyssey

As of `0.15.2`, all MUI and Odyssey components are exported from `@okta/odyssey-react-mui`. No further need to maintain a separate version of MUI.

If you're using components not supported by Odyssey, please get your product designers in touch with Odyssey to see what we need to do going forward.

It's possible you need to still have your own MUI version, but it's possible there's an Odyssey design solution.

Also, Odyssey-Labs exists for this very purpose; things that you want in Odyssey, but we haven't had a finalized design.

### Theming

Odyssey now includes theme components and CSP nonce built into it's `OdysseyProvider` wrapper. Just like MUI's `ThemeProvider`, this needs to go at the top-level of your app and takes no props.

In a later update, this component will be renamed `OdysseyProvider`.

#### Custom Theming

It's possible you want to customize Odyssey's theme because of your app's requirements. You'll want `OdysseyProvider` (MUI and Odyssey theme wrapper).

At this point, we still export `MuiThemeProvider`

### `useTheme`

- `typography.body` is now `typography.body1`.
- `typography.caption` is now `typography.subtitle`.
