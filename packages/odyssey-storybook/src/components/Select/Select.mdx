# Select

Often referred to as a “dropdown menu” this input triggers a menu of options a user can select. Country and state Selects are common examples.

## Anatomy

## Behavior

Interacting with a Select displays a list of values to choose from. Choosing a value will override any previous selection and close the Select.

Odyssey also supports a Multi-Select variant that allows users to select many values.

To support expected functionality and behaviors, Select relies on the Choices.js library. Odyssey provides fallback styling when Choices.js isn't available.

## Variants

Odyssey provides support for both single and multi-value Selects.

### Single Select

The default Select allows users to choose a single value from a list of options. Selecting another option will replace the first.

**STORY MISSING**

### Multi-Select

The Multi-Select variant allows users to choose more than one value from the list of options.

## States

Select inputs support the following states: enabled, hover, focus, disabled, optional, and invalid.

### Enabled

Select inputs in their "normal" state are considered enabled. They are ready for user interaction.

**STORY MISSING**

### Hover

Hover states are activated when the user pauses their pointer over the input.

**STORY MISSING**

### Focus

The focus state is a visual affordance that the user has highlighted the input with a pointer, keyboard, or voice.

**STORY MISSING**

### Disabled

Disabled inputs are unavailable for interaction and cannot be focused. They can be used when input is disallowed, possibly due to a system state or access restrictions.

The values of disabled inputs will not be submitted.

**STORY MISSING**

### Optional

Odyssey assumes inputs are required by default. Optional inputs should be used to indicate when data is not required for the user to complete a task.

**STORY MISSING**

### Invalid

The invalid state is for inputs with incorrect values or values of the wrong format.

When indicating a validation error, please use a Field Error label to indicate the nature of the error. Color alone is not an accessible way to signify that something has gone wrong.

## Usage

Selects are most useful when users are choosing between 7-15 options. For smaller sets, Radio Buttons are more effective. For larger sets, a Text Input with autocompletion may be a better fit.

Selects perform better when the options are familiar to the user. If a user may be unfamiliar with their options or need to compare them, use Radio Buttons.

Select inputs should not have a default selected unless a majority of users will be choosing it.

### Option groups

Options may be grouped within the Select list to help guide users. When doing this, consider that Choices will ignore any ungrouped items.
