# Tooltip

A transient element that provides additional context for an element when it receives hover or focus.

## Anatomy

**ANATOMY MISSING**

## Behavior

Tooltips activate when a cursor hovers over an element, or an element receives focus. They can be triggered both by a parent container or a paired sibling.

Tooltips vanish when a user stops hovering or changes focus. To maintain parity with the browser's tooltip behavior, they will not disappear otherwise.

The cursor displayed when hovering UI is determined by the element, not the Tooltip.

## Usage

Use Tooltips to help users understand unfamiliar objects or states that aren’t described by the visible UI.

Well-placed tooltips provide info when needed and need minimal user effort to trigger.

### Use when...

#### No text label is present

Use Tooltips with all controls that rely solely on iconography for communicating meaning.

This is especially important to distinguish between visually or contextually similar UI. Tooltips are also helpful with rarely-used features or features with variant interpretations.

Our <a href="/components/button/">Button</a> component offers more guidance if needed.

#### An element benefits from supplemental information

This may be the case for disabled controls or inline content like abbreviations.

**STORY MISSING**

### Don't use when...

#### Users need to interact with the content

Tooltips are transient by design, which makes them a bad candidate for interactive content. Do not include links, buttons, or other controls within a Tooltip.

**STORY MISSING**

#### Rich content or imagery is required

Tooltips should provide simple, textual descriptions. If your content requires formatting or imagery, users may have difficulty parsing them.

### Positioning Tooltips

When positioning a Tooltip, ensure:

- The Tooltip is paired with the element being described.
- You plan for responsive web design concerns.
- Placement doesn't interfere with the object of interest or relevant information.
- The Tooltip is always visible when activated, not cropped or off-page.

## Content

### Succinct

Tooltips should contain short, descriptive text. A single sentence or even a sentence fragment is ideal.

The content should be new information. Tooltips should not repeat copy from visible UI.

### Static

Tooltips should contain static content. Users don't expect, and are unlikely to notice, dynamic changes to Tooltip contents.

**Exception:** Tooltips may contain dynamic content if two requirements are met:

- The tooltip is present at all times during the content change
- The tooltip is reporting real-time change (e.g. "Copy" changes to "Copied!" on a click-to-copy button)

## Accessibility

### Animation

Per <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#tooltip">ARIA guidelines</a>, our tooltips triggered by hovering or focusing UI and employ a short delay before animating.

### Tooltip as a label

When using tooltips as a label, assistive technologies will treat the Tooltip content as a name.

Assistive technologies will read out this example as "Edit".

## Responsive considerations

Focusing and hovering are typically unavailable on touchscreen devices. Some devices may also trigger a "click" at the same time. For this reason, Tooltips may be completely invisible for users of these devices.

Consider fallback alternatives on a case-by-case basis.

When possible, provide inline text that becomes visible on touchscreen devices. Otherwise, a fixed-position fallback is provided for mobile devices.
