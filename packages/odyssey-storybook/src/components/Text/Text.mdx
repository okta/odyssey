## Props

<ArgsTable />

## Variants

### span (default)

> The `<span>` HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. `<span>` is very much like a `<div>` element, but `<div>` is a block-level element whereas a `<span>` is an inline element. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span)

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-text-elements--span" />
</Canvas>

### abbr

> The HTML `<abbr>` element represents an abbreviation or acronym; the optional title attribute can provide an expansion or description for the abbreviation. If present, title must contain this full description and nothing else. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr)

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-text-elements--abbr" />
</Canvas>

### address

> The HTML `<address>` element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address)",

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-text-elements--address" />
</Canvas>

### blockquote

> The `<blockquote>` HTML element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the `<cite>` element. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote)",

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-text-elements--blockquote" />
</Canvas>

### cite

> The HTML Citation element (`<cite>`) is used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and must include the title of that work. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite)

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-text-elements--cite" />
</Canvas>

### code

> The `<code>` HTML element displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. By default, the content text is displayed using the user agent's default monospace font. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code)

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-text-elements--code" />
</Canvas>

### del

> The `del` HTML element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information, for example. The `ins` element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del)

#### Accessibility

Many screen readers do not let users know of the presence of `del`. To fix this, you should consider using the ScreenReaderText component to prepend and append assistive text to the contents of the tag. In the above example, there are additional spaces before and after the text, this is intentional. Not adding these spaces will cause the content within the tag to run into the text within the tag.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-text-elements--del" />
</Canvas>

### dfn

> The `dfn` is used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence. The `p` element, the `dt`/`dd` pairing, or the `section` element which is the nearest ancestor of the `dfn` is considered to be the definition of the term. - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Eldfnent/dfn)

There are multiple, valid ways to use `dfn`. For the sake of usability, Odyssey recommends you follow one of two formats.

For most terms, the content of `dfn` should be term you are defining.

## Usage

### Styled element insertion

Text enables authors and components to insert styled HTML elements without the need for a global CSS sheet.

```jsx
<Text as="p">
  We <Text as="em">really</Text> need to get off this planet.
</Text>
```

A more complicated example might look like this:

```jsx
<Text as="blockquote">
  <Text as="p">
    The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason
    for existence.
  </Text>
  <footer>
    Albert Einstein,
    <Text as="cite">
      Old Man's Advice to Youth: "Never Lose a Holy Curiosity," LIFE magazine (2
      May 1955) statement to William Miller, p. 64.
    </Text>
  </footer>
</Text>
```
