# Table

Tables provide structure for displaying sets of data across rows and columns. They support multiple content types and some internal actions.

## Anatomy

**ANATOMY MISSING**

## Behavior

### Sorting tables

Sorting Table columns is a common interaction for users. Following standard conventions will ensure a consistent experience:

Any sortable column should display the appropriate icon for its state: ascending, descending, or unsorted.

When an unsorted heading is clicked, the column should sort in ascending (A to Z) order.

When an ascending heading is clicked, it should swap to descending (Z to A) order.

Finally, when a descending heading is clicked, it should swap to unsorted.

When any column becomes sorted, the previously active column should return to an unsorted state.

## States

### Empty tables

If no data is returned - whether due to filtering or an empty data set - be sure to provide a null state for your users. If you can detect why no data was returned, make that clear in the tfoot.
The data-null attribute will ensure the table styling is adjusted.

<Story id="components-table--empty-table" />

## Usage

Note that tables should not have a fixed width, nor should their columns. Browsers divide space based on content and forced white-space will hurt readability. To ensure rogue strings don't cause visual wonk, we limit cells widths to ~45 characters.

### Row headings

If your data set has keys on two axes, we also support setting the starting column as a row heading. This is helpful when you expect the user tuseze a known value for data lookup (e.g. "Which missions went to Mars?").

Be sure to identify your row heading column as well. That is, don't leave a blank cell in the starting header column. Our secondary headings need context too!

### Row groupings

If you need to group rows by a shared data point, we also support using rowspan to do so. Otherwise, follow the same implementation guidelines as above.

Note: spanning multiple rows or columns may cause issues for assistive technologies.

## Content guidelines

Titles & captions should describe the table the user is viewing. They are not abstractions.

Reserve the starting column for your most important data. Cascade lower priority data toward the end.

Don't use long column headings. Try to keep them as short as or shorter than your column content.

Don’t create complex interactions that change the state of the row. Tables are primarily for reviewing data, not interacting with it.

### Supported content types

The basic Table cell styling is based on what is most legible and scannable for a normal string of text. However, different data types may need alternate styling.

Currently, we provide extra support for numerical data, dates, Buttons, Statuses, and Checkboxes.

**STORY MISSING**

<ul>
<li class="desc-counter--item">

<h4 class="desc-counter--title">Checkboxes</h4>

Include checkboxes in the first column. The heading checkbox should check/uncheck all rows when clicked.

If mixed, the heading checkbox should be set to Indeterminate.

</li>
<li class="desc-counter--item">

<h4 class="desc-counter--title">Numerical data</h4>

We use tabular numbers and end-align figures for quick scanning.

Leave off any units. Instead, specify them in the column's header.

</li>
<li class="desc-counter--item">

<h4 class="desc-counter--title">Statuses</h4>

No extra styling is required when adding Statuses to your table. Ensure their labels are hidden and their column has an appropriate heading.

</li>
<li class="desc-counter--item">

<h4 class="desc-counter--title">Dates</h4>

To maintain ease of reading, dates should not be line-broken. White-space is preserved throughout the column. This applies to all date formats.

</li>
<li class="desc-counter--item">

<h4 class="desc-counter--title">Empty cells</h4>

If a cell is empty, use an en dash (–) to indicate this.

</li>
<li class="desc-counter--item">

<h4 class="desc-counter--title">Buttons</h4>

No extra styling is required when adding Buttons to a table. They will resize to the "Small" variant and align to the baseline of other type in the row.

</li>
</ul>

## Accessibility

### Titles and captions

Each Table should have both a title and a caption.

The title is the visible heading for your table. A concise, descriptive title will provide users with a direct context for your data. The needed context may be missing if you rely on page headings or surrounding body copy.

Captions are visually hidden. Providing a caption will give users of assistive technologies context for the table before it is accessed.

### Complicated tables

Try to refrain from using complicated table layouts that rely on colspan or rowspan.

This same advice applies to nested tables or hidden rows as well. They can introduce problems that make your table inaccessible for some users.
