# Button

A clickable button used for form submissions and most in-page interactions.

## Anatomy

**ANATOMY MISSING: Button**

**ANATOMY MISSING: Button w/ Icon**

## Behavior

Visually, a Button is a rounded rectangle with a descriptive caption at its center. Users interact with Buttons via both pointer devices and keystrokes.

## Variants

In Odyssey there are five Button variants: Primary, Secondary, Danger, Clear, and Dismiss.

### Primary

Use our default Button for primary actions in a view. For example, “Save”.

It's ideal to have one Primary Button per view. However, it's okay to have more than one Primary Button as long that they are equal in priority.

  <Story id="components-button--primary" />
</Canvas>

### Secondary

This is ideal for a secondary actions to compliment the Primary Button. Like the Primary Button, use this Button sparingly to provide focus to the user.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--secondary" />
</Canvas>

### Danger

Use Danger Buttons for scenarios where a user may be deleting information or making a decision that can not be reversed.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--danger" />
</Canvas>

### Clear

Use Clear Buttons for interactions that change visible UI but don't submit data. For example, showing a password field or dismissing a modal.

They pair well with Primary and Secondary Buttons.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--clear" />
</Canvas>

### Dismiss

The Dismiss Button should only be used for dismissing UI. Typically, this Button is included as part of a larger Odyssey component, but may be useful when constructing unique UIs.

The Dismiss Button has unique padding and will inherit the text color of it's parent UI.

  <Story id="components-button--dismiss" />
</Canvas>

## Sizes

We offer three sizes of Buttons for use: Small, Medium, and Large. Full-width buttons are also available.

In order to provide a sufficient click area, all Button labels have a minimum width equal to twice the line-height.

### Small

Small Buttons are best used for actions within Table rows. Their font-size is descreased while keeping padding proportional to our medium size.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--small" />
</Canvas>

### Medium

Our default size, medium Buttons are built for use in most contexts.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--medium" />
</Canvas>

### Large

Large Buttons incease their padding, but not their font size. They're intended for single-interaction UIs like logging in.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--large" />
</Canvas>

### Full-width

Full-width Buttons are intended for single-interaction UIs. These are often widgets like "Sign In" or "Sign Up".

Use this variant when you desire the Button to be full-width regardless of screen size.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--wide" />
</Canvas>

## States

Odyssey provides visual affordances these states: Enabled, Focus, Hover, and Disabled.

### Enabled

Buttons in their "normal" state are considered enabled. They are ready for user interaction.

**STORY MISSING**

### Focus

The focus state is a visual affordance that the user has highlighted the Button with a pointer, keyboard, or voice.

**STORY MISSING**

### Hover

Hover states are activated when the user pauses their pointer over the Button.

**STORY MISSING**

### Disabled

Disabled Buttons are unavailable for interaction and cannot be focused. They can be used when an action is unavailable, possibly due to incomplete information or access restrictions.

You should pair Disabled Buttons with a Tooltip if the user would benefit from additional context.

**STORY MISSING**

## Usage

Use Buttons to indicate the in-page actions a user can take.

**STORY MISSING**

Don't use Buttons to navigate users around the site or product; use links instead.

## Content Guidelines

Consider the following when writing content for Buttons. By doing so, it will ensure users can easily navigate the page and complete the task at hand efficiently.

### Context

Provide enough context to ensure the user is aware what the interaction will achieve. Avoid patterns that require the user to discover what a Button does.

**STORY MISSING**

Be strategic in your Button placement so a user has the best context. For example, consider using Buttons at the end of a form or preceding them with supporting copy.

**STORY MISSING**

### Word count

Don't use more than three words inside of a Button. If a user needs more context, consider other design solutions.

### Capitalization

When using multiple words, use sentence case. Capitalize only the first letter and any proper nouns.

### Buttons with Icons

Icons can be added to any of our Button variants to increase clarity or add flair. Icons will be laid out automatically based on language direction.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--with-icon" />
</Canvas>

#### Icon-only usability

We recommend pairing icon-only Buttons with our Tooltip. While this is not required, it will increase clarity for sighted users.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--icon-only" />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

Color is not a clear affordance for all users, please use clear, concise copy to label Buttons. Good rules of thumb: use three or less words to describe your action and start your label with a verb (e.g. "Access report" vs "Report PDF").
