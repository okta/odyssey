`<Box>` is a utility component that renders a simple HTML `<div>`, which can then be used for styling or layout. CSS properties
can be set using the `sx` prop, as detailed in the [MUI documentation on `sx`](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/).
The component can also be set to render another element besides `<div>`.

`<Box>` is useful as an "escape hatch" when you need to create a layout or pattern not yet supported by Odyssey.
