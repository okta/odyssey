# Select

Often referred to as a “dropdown menu” this input triggers a menu of options a user can select. Country and state Selects are common examples.

  <Story id="mui-components-forms-select--default" />
</Canvas>

## Behavior

Interacting with a Select displays a list of values to choose from. Choosing a value will override any previous selection and close the Select.

Odyssey also supports a Multi-Select variant that allows users to select many values.

## Variants

Odyssey provides support for both single and multi-value Selects.

### Single Select

The default Select allows users to choose a single value from a list of options. Selecting another option will replace the first.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-select--default" />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-select--default-disabled" />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-select--default-error" />
</Canvas>

### Option datatypes

`<Select>` accepts `options` in two formats:

1. A flat array, in which case the value of each option is the same as its name
2. An object with values for keys `value` and `name`

Here's a `<Select>` that uses an object for its options:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-select--default-object" />
</Canvas>

Here's a `<Select>` that uses mixed data types, including headings:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-select--default-grouped" />
</Canvas>

### Multi-Select

The Multi-Select variant allows users to choose more than one value from the list of options.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-select--multi" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

Selects are most useful when users are choosing between 7-15 options. For smaller sets, Radio Buttons are more effective. For larger sets, a Text Input with autocompletion may be a better fit.

Selects perform better when the options are familiar to the user. If a user may be unfamiliar with their options or need to compare them, use Radio Buttons.

Select inputs should not have a default selected unless a majority of users will be choosing it.
