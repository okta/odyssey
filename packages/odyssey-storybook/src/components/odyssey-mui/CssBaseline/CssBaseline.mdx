# CSS Baseline

Odyssey provides two components that insert "global" styles into your application, `<CssBaseline>` and `<ScopedCssBaseline>`.

## `<CssBaseline>`

The `<CssBaseline>` component updates the `<html>` and `<body>` elements to provide page-wide defaults expected by Odyssey.

This component is required and should be inserted at the top of your view.

### Layout

- The `box-sizing` property is set to `border-box` on the `<html>` element. Every element is declared to inherit this property, ensuring that the element's declared width properly reflects the padding or border.
- Removes margin on these elements in all browsers

### Typography

- `theme.typography.fontSize` is declared on `<html>`, setting the base for all rem units
- The `theme.typography.body1` style is applied to the `<body>` element
- `theme.typography.fontWeightBold` is set for the `<b>` and `<strong>` elements
- Enables font-smoothing for improved readability

## `<ScopedCssBaseline>`

The `<ScopedCssBaseline>` component provides additional, optional element styles.

These styles will only apply to children of `<ScopedCssBaseline>`.

### kbd

> The HTML Keyboard Input element (`<kbd>`) represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a `<kbd>` element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard. - <cite><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd'>MDN</a></cite>

#### Usage

When combined with <a href="#samp">`<samp>`</a>, the background of this element will swap to white for better contrast.

### p

> The `<p>` HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields. - <cite><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p'>MDN</a></cite>
