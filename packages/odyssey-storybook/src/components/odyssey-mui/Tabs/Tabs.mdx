### Keyboard Support

<figure className="ods-table--figure">
  <table className="ods-table">
    <caption>Tabs support the following keyboard shortcuts</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="column">Key</th>
        <th scope="column">Behavior</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row" rowSpan="2">
          <kbd>Tab</kbd>
        </th>
        <td>
          When focus moves in to <code>tablist</code> the focus is placed on the
          first <code>tab</code> element.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Unlike the right arrow key, if you Tab past the last element, the Tab
          focus continues down the page as normal. In this case, it should set
          focus in to the active <code>tabpanel</code>
        </td>

      <tr>
        <th scope="row">

        </th>
        <td>
          When focus is placed on a Tab, the corresponding <code>tabpanel</code>{" "}
          is activated/displayed.
