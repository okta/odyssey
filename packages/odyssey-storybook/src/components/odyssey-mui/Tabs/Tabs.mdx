# Tabs

Navigation component used to organize content by grouping similar information on the same page. They allow content to be viewed without having to navigate away from that page or route.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-tabs--default" />
</Canvas>

## Behavior

Users interact with Tabs as they would a button, the main difference is the outcome. By default, the first Tab is active and the associated content displayed in the Tab panel. Upon selecting a different Tab, the Tab indicator appears on the selected Tab. The Tab panel will then update to show the new content.

Additionally, the Tab element is keyboard-navigable (See [Accessibility: Keyboard Support](#keyboard-support))

## Usage

Tabs were created to shorten long pages. Before you use these, we'd recommend laying
out all of the content on your page out first. From there, figure out common themes and
see what could be grouped together. Those themes should become your Tabs.

### Relate to the page title

Tabs are not navigation. Meaning they don't take you from place to place. Rather, they are meant for context switching related to the page.

### Position above major content

Tabs are best used at the top of the page or situated above the content it's related to. This will help establish hierarchy.

### Don't nest Tabs

Use Tab sparingly. Limit the Tab component to one per page, and refrain from including a second set of Tabs within a Tabpanel.

## Content Guidelines

- Don't have more than 8 Tabs in a Tablist
- Don't add icons to Tabs
