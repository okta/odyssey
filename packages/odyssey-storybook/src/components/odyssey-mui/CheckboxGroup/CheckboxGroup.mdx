# Checkbox Group

Checkboxes appear as a square shaped UI accompanied by a caption. Checkboxes can be found in tables, forms, or in and around text inputs.

## Behavior

Users can click a Checkbox to make a choice and click it again to deselect an option. They allow users to select one or more options of something.

Checkboxes may appear individually or as a group.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Single} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Group} />
</Canvas>

### Required Checkboxes

Unlike other inputs, Odyssey assumes Checkboxes are optional by default.

Individual checkboxes can be set to required. This is useful when a user confirms they have read the terms of service.

## States

Checkboxes support several states: enabled, hover, focus, disabled, invalid, required, and indeterminate.

### Enabled

Checkboxes in their "unchecked" state are considered enabled. They are ready for user interaction.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Group} />
</Canvas>

### Checked

Checked Checkboxes, sometimes referred to as "ticked", display a check to indicate the they are selected.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Checked} />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

Disabled inputs are unavailable for interaction and cannot be focused. They can be used when input is disallowed, possibly due to a system state or access restrictions.

Checkboxes may be disabled individually or as a group. The values of disabled inputs will not be submitted.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Disabled} />
</Canvas>

### Invalid

Checkboxes present as invalid when a required input is left unchecked or an incompatible choice has been made.

When indicating a validation error, please use FormHelperText set to `error` to indicate the nature of the problem. Color alone is not an accessible way to signify that something has gone wrong.

Unlike Radio Buttons, Checkboxes validate individually, not as a group. Validity must be set individually on each checkbox using the `isInvalid` prop, even if the group has an `errorMessage` set.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Error} />
</Canvas>

Individual checkboxes can take a different validity than the whole group; if a group is invalid, individual checkboxes can be marked valid, and vice versa. This is particularly useful in cases
where the state of particular checkboxes affect the validity of the entire group.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.MixedError} />
</Canvas>

### Indeterminate

In the case of nested checkboxes, an indeterminate state may be required.

Note that this state is visual-only and will be submitted as either "checked" or "unchecked" depending on the internal state.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Indeterminate} />
</Canvas>
