# Text Field

Text fields allow users to edit and input data.

## Variants

### Default

This default serves as the basis for our Text Inputs.

</Canvas>

### Textarea

Textareas should be used for multi-line text inputs. As the user types the field will grow vertically to accommodate the new lines.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-textfield--multiline" />
</Canvas>

### Hints

### Adornments

Adornments may be added to inputs to create additional affordances or behavior. Odyssey supports icon and text adornments.

## States

Text fields support the following states: enabled, hover, focus, disabled, read-only, optional, and invalid.

### Enabled

Text fields in their "normal" state are considered enabled. They are ready for user interaction.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-textfield--default" />
</Canvas>

### Optional

Text fields in Odyssey are assumed to be required by default. Setting required to `false` will introduce an "Optional" affordance.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-textfield--optional" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

Disabled inputs are unavailable for interaction and cannot be focused. They can be used when input is disallowed, possibly due to a system state or access restrictions.

The values of disabled inputs will not be submitted.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-textfield--disabled" />
</Canvas>

### Read-only

Similar to disabled inputs, users cannot modify the values of read-only inputs. However, users can otherwise interact with read-only inputs and select their values for copying.

This state can be helpful when displaying computed or third-party values, or when a submitted form is being processed.

The values of read-only inputs will be submitted.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-textfield--read-only" />
</Canvas>

### Invalid

The invalid state is for inputs with incorrect values or values of the wrong format.

When indicating a validation error, please use a Field Error label to indicate the nature of the error. Color alone is not an accessible way to signify that something has gone wrong.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-textfield--error" />
</Canvas>

## Input Types

Text fields support most free-form content, but we offer specific support for email, telephone numbers, and passwords.

### Email

There are no specific UI changes for email addresses, but inputs of this type will validate that the address is properly formatted.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-textfield--email" />
</Canvas>

### Tel

Unlike email fields, tel inputs are not automatically validated because global formats are so varied.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-textfield--tel" />
</Canvas>
