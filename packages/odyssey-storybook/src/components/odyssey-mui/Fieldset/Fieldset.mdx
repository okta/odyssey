# Fieldset

The fieldset component allows you to group related fields within a form.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Simple} />
</Canvas>

## Content

Fieldset supports standardized legends, descriptions, and child fields.

### Legends and descriptions

Fieldsets require a legend that describes the group.

An additional description can follow the heading.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Description} />
</Canvas>

### Errors

When multiple input selections are incompatible, the whole group may be made invalid.

In this case, an infobox should be inserted at the top of the fieldset. This alert should persist until all input errors are resolved.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Alert} />
</Canvas>
