# RadioGroup

Use radio buttons when a user must make a single selection from a list of two or more options that are mutually exclusive.

## About

Radio buttons are wrapped into a radio group so we can visually present groups of options as distinct and separate from other possible groups on the same page.

### When to use

#### Radio group vs Checkbox

Radio buttons allow the user to select 1 option. Checkboxes, in contrast, are independent of all the other checkboxes and multiple options can be selected at the same time.

#### Radio group vs Select

Consider how you wish to present your list of options to the user. A radio group will display all possible options and make it easy to compare them without the need to first interact with the component, lowering the cognitive load for users.

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-radiogroup--default" />
</Canvas>

### Hint text

The hint text is placed in between the label and the radio buttons.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-radiogroup--hint" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

Disabled inputs block any possible user interaction and cannot be focused.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-radiogroup--disabled" />
</Canvas>

### Error

Validation should happen on the group and not individually on each item.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-forms-radiogroup--error" />
</Canvas>

## Anatomy

### Label

The label helps the user understand the group of options provided and in making a selection.

### Radio button input and label

Radio buttons make up the list of available options within a group.<br/>
The list is laid out vertically with one choice per line and by default one of the options is selected.<br/>
If users need to withhold an answer you should provide a neutral option for this.

### Hint text (optional)

This is an optional property that includes in-context descriptions to clarify the grouping or explain the set of options.<br/>
Hints should not include long-form content or rich text as it visually separates the intended label from the input area.

## Behaviors

### States

A radio button has 2 states: Selected and Unselected.<br/>
By default one of the options within the list should be selected. Once another option is triggered the previous selection will be deselected.<br/>
On top of the previous two states, radio buttons can also exist in all the other states needed for form inputs: `focus`, `disabled`, and `invalid`.

### Interactions

A radio button can be selected from either the radio input or the radio label, this provides a better affordance for the user.
