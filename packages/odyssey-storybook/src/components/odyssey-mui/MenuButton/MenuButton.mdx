# Menu Button

A menu button is a button that, when triggered, displays a list of actions for the user to choose from.

## Overview

The Menu button component includes a button and a menu that contains menu items. Each menu item can be chosen to perform a different action.

### When to use

- Use when you need to display multiple actions but there is a space constraint.

### When not to use

- If the user needs to make a selection within a form, use form elements such as select, radio, or checkboxes.
- For expanding and collapsing section, use accordion.

## Variants

### Trigger button variants

The menu button is just like the regular button with additional functions. Regardless of the additional function, the menu button uses the same styles and properties that are available with Button.

#### Dropdown button

Dropdown buttons are styled just like the regular buttons (primary, secondary, floating) but they have trailing chevron-down icon to indicate that there is additional content once toggled.

#### Icon button

When using an icon button as a trigger we pair it with the overflow-vertical icon.

To ensure accessibility in these cases, utilize `tooltipTitle` to provide a label.

  <Story id="mui-components-menu-button--icon-button" />
</Canvas>

### Menu item variants

#### Icons

Menu items by default are a plain label that explains the actions. An icon can also be included next to the label if it reinforces the label.

  <Story id="mui-components-menu-button--action-icons" />

#### Grouping

You can group sections of actions within the menu by using a divider line, a section heading or both.

  <Story id="mui-components-menu-button--groupings" />
</Canvas>

#### Destructive actions

Actions may be marked as destructive by using the `isDestructive` prop on the associated item.

  <Story id="mui-components-menu-button--with-destructive" />
</Canvas>

## Behaviors

### Placement

Menus are positioned under their anchor element, unless they are close to the bottom of the viewport.

### Scrolling

When a menu has scrolling, the last item should be 50% visible in the container so that it is clear that there is more content available.

### List order

Order your menu list in an intentional way that will facilitate the user in finding a specific value. There is not one way to this but you can consider the following options:

- Organize the list in an alphabetical order.
- Show the most used options at the top of the list.
- Group list items into multiple categories.

### Closing the menu

When an action is selected from the list, the menu collapses and the action is performed.

Additionally, a user can click outside of the menu or press the esc key and the menu will also collapse.

## Accessibility

Here are some accessibility guidelines to follow when using the Menu Button component:

- Use descriptive and concise text for the button label.
- Make sure the button has a focus state so that it is clear when the button is in focus.
- Ensure ARIA attributes indicate that the button has a dropdown menu and to describe the menu items.
- Make sure the dropdown menu can be accessed with the keyboard.
- Use descriptive and concise text for the menu items.
