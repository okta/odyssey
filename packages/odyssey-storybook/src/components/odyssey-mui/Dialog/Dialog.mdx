# Dialog

UI that appears on top of the main content and moves the system into a mode requiring user interaction. This dialog disables the main content until the user interacts with the dialog dialog.

## Behavior

Dialogs are inserted above the main content as a blocking mechanism to ask for user input or confirm an action. They disable all other contexts until the user interacts with the dialog itself.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-dialog--default" />
</Canvas>

While dialogs should contain concise, actionable content, longer dialogs are also supported:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-dialog--long" />
</Canvas>

A dialog may include up to three footer buttons (one primary, one secondary, and one tertiary), or as few as zero:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-dialog--no-buttons" />
</Canvas>

### Arrival

How dialogs arrive on the screen is as important as the content they contain. Animation does more than provide a pleasing experience. It contextualizes the new UI the user is being presented.

### Dismissing

Users may close dialogs by clicking on the button in the upper, ending corner of the container. They may also click anywhere outside of the container, within the "curtain".

### Autofocus

Focus is placed on the first item a user can select, allowing them to immediately exit or submit the dialog when possible. Focus is limited to the scope of the dialog while the dialog is open.

## Usage

The default dialog allows users to interact with and alter the experience it is currently interrupting. Dialogs interrupt a user's experience. This may be bothersome, and dialogs should be used with discretion. If a dialog is becoming complicated or claustrophobic, another solution may be needed.

### Use when...

- Blocking user interaction for security reasons - e.g. "Please reenter your password to initiate launch."
- Gathering immediate information to continue a task - e.g. "A hangar number is required to continue."
- Confirming user interaction during destructive actions - e.g. "Please confirm the starship name to begin disassembly."
- Offering an alternative that would lessen the user's required effort - e.g. "Additional security clearance will be required - are you sure you want to continue?"

### Don't use when...

- Immediate action is not required
- The dialog would interrupt a workflow
- Additional context may be required or helpful
- The dialog content is long-form
- The user has not triggered the dialog via interaction (e.g. on page load)
- There is already a dialog being displayed

## Content guidelines

Context is key. There needs to be a direct connection between the trigger (i.e. a button or link) and the dialog that follows. Repeating the trigger's copy within the dialog can help reinforce this connection. Providing a sense of connection between the trigger and dialog is important to ensure a consistent user experience.

## Accessibility

### Accessible behavior

When a user opens a dialog, interaction is limited to the new context. While this may seem expected, it can surprise users. This is heightened for users requiring assistive technologies.

For convenience, users can exit the dialog in a few ways:

- Clicking on the overlay

- Hitting <kbd>esc</kbd>

- Clicking or navigating to any element tagged with an appropriate `onClick`

For users happy with their new context, we ensure their attention isn't misdirected. Scrolling on the main content becomes locked, and we inform the browser to lock the `tabindex` to the dialog context. This way, regardless of input method, a user's interactions are limited to their new scope.
