# Checkbox

Checkboxes appear as a square shaped UI accompanied by a caption. Checkboxes can be found in tables, forms, or in and around text inputs.

## Behavior

Users can click a Checkbox to make a choice and click it again to deselect an option. They allow users to select one or more options of something.

Checkboxes may appear individually or as a group.

</Canvas>

### Required Checkboxes

Unlike other inputs, Odyssey assumes Checkboxes are optional by default.

Individual checkboxes can be set to required. This is useful when a user confirms they have read the terms of service.

## States

Checkboxes support several states: enabled, hover, focus, disabled, invalid, required, and indeterminate.

### Enabled

Checkboxes in their "unchecked" state are considered enabled. They are ready for user interaction.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-checkbox--group" />
</Canvas>

### Checked

Checked Checkboxes, sometimes referred to as "ticked", display a check to indicate the they are selected.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-checkbox--checked" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

Disabled inputs are unavailable for interaction and cannot be focused. They can be used when input is disallowed, possibly due to a system state or access restrictions.

Checkboxes may be disabled individually or as a group. The values of disabled inputs will not be submitted.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mui-components-checkbox--disabled" />
</Canvas>

### Invalid

Checkboxes present as invalid when a required input is left unchecked or an incompatible choice has been made.

When indicating a validation error, please use FormHelperText set to `error` to indicate the nature of the problem. Color alone is not an accessible way to signify that something has gone wrong.

Unlike Radio Buttons, Checkboxes validate individually, not as a group.

</Canvas>

### Indeterminate

In the case of nested checkboxes, an indeterminate state may be required.

Note that this state is visual-only and will be submitted as either "checked" or "unchecked" depending on the internal state.
