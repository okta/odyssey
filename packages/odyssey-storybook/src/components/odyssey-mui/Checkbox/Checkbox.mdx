# Checkbox

Checkboxes appear as a square shaped UI accompanied by a caption. Checkboxes can be found in tables, forms, or in and around text inputs.

## Required checkboxes

Checkboxes are optional by default, and there are few circumstances in which a checkbox is required. Odyssey provides an `isRequired` boolean that, when set to `true`, makes the checkbox required. Note that when a checkbox is required, it must be checked for the form to submit, so this is only appropriate for checkboxes that must be checked to continue, such as a confirmation.
