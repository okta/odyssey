# Select

Often referred to as a “dropdown menu” this input triggers a menu of options a user can select. Country and state Selects are common examples.

  <Story of={Stories.Default} />

## Behavior

Interacting with a NativeSelect displays a list of values to choose from. Choosing a value will override any previous selection and close the NativeSelect.

Odyssey also supports a Multi-Select variant that allows users to select many values.

## Variants

Odyssey provides support for both single and multi-value NativeSelects.

### Single Select

The default NativeSelect allows users to choose a single value from a list of options. Selecting another option will replace the first.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Default} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.DefaultDisabled} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.DefaultError} />
</Canvas>

#### Grouped Options

NativeSelect can incldue `<option>`s and `<optgroup>`s as children.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.DefaultGrouped} />
</Canvas>

### Multi-Select

The Multi-Select variant allows users to choose more than one value from the list of options.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Multi} />
</Canvas>

## Usage

Selects are most useful when users are choosing between 7-15 options. For smaller sets, Radio Buttons are more effective. For larger sets, a Text Input with autocompletion may be a better fit.

Selects perform better when the options are familiar to the user. If a user may be unfamiliar with their options or need to compare them, use Radio Buttons.

Select inputs should not have a default selected unless a majority of users will be choosing it.
