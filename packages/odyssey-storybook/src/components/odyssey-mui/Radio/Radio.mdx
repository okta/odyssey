# Radio

Radios appear as a ring shaped UI accompanied by a caption that allows the user to choose only one option at a time.

## Behavior

Radio Buttons allow users to select one option from a set. Users can click a Radio to make a choice; selecting another will deselect the last.

## States

The most prominent Radio states are `enabled`, `disabled`, and `invalid`.

### Enabled

Radio Buttons in their "unchecked" state are considered enabled. They are ready for user interaction.

### Disabled

Disabled inputs are unavailable for interaction and cannot be focused. They can be used when input is disallowed, possibly due to a system state or access restrictions.

Radios may be disabled as a group or individually.

### Invalid

Radios are invalid when a required input is left unchecked or an incompatible choice has been made.

When indicating a validation error, please use FormHelperText set to `error` to indicate the nature of the problem. Color alone is not an accessible way to signify that something has gone wrong.

Unlike Checkboxes, Radios validate as a group, not individually.
