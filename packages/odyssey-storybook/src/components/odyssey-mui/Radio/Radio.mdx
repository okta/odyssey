# Radio

Use radio buttons when a user must make a single selection from a list of two or more options that are mutually exclusive.

## Overview

Radio buttons are wrapped into a radio group so we can visually present groups of options as distinct and separate from other possible groups in the same page.

### When to use

#### Radio group vs Checkbox
Radio buttons allow the user to select 1 option. Checkboxes, in contrast, are independent of all the other checkboxes and multiple options can be selected at the same time.

#### Radio group vs Select
Consider how you wish to present your list of options to the user. A radio group will display all possible options and make it easy to compare them without the need to first interact with the component, lowering the cognitive load for users.
