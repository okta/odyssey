# Radio

Use radio buttons when a user must make a single selection from a list of two or more options that are mutually exclusive.

## About

Radio buttons are wrapped into a radio group so we can visually present groups of options as distinct and separate from other possible groups on the same page.

### When to use

#### Radio group vs Checkbox

Radio buttons allow the user to select 1 option. Checkboxes, in contrast, are independent of all the other checkboxes and multiple options can be selected at

#### Radio group vs Select

Consider how you wish to present your list of options to the user. A radio group will display all possible options and make it easy to compare them without the need to first interact with the component, lowering the cognitive load for users.

### Label

The label helps the user understand the group of options provided and in making a selection.

### Radio button input and label

Radio buttons make up the list of available options within a group. The list is laid out vertically with one choice per line.
By default radio button have one of the options selected. If users need to withhold an answer you should provide a neutral option for this.

A radio button can be selected from either the radio input or the radio label, this provides a better affordance for the user.

### Hint text (optional)

The hint text is placed in between the label and the radio buttons.
This is an optional property that includes in-context descriptions to clarify the grouping or explain the set of options.
Hints should not include long-form content or rich text as it visually separates the intended label from the input area.

## Behaviors

### States

A radio button has 2 states: Selected and Unselected.
By default one of the options within the list should be selected. Once another option is triggered the previous selection will be deselected.

On top of the previous two states, radio buttons can also exist in all the other states needed for form inputs: `focus`, `disabled`, and `invalid`.
