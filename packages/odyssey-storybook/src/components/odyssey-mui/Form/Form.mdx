# Form

The form component arranges input controls to help with the layout and building of a form.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Simple} />
</Canvas>

## Content

Form supports standardized titles, descriptions, error messaging, fieldsets, fields, and actions.

### Titles and descriptions

Forms should include a heading that describes the form. This heading may be provided by the form's context; for example, a modal or page's title.

An additional description can follow the heading.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Description} />
</Canvas>

### Errors

### Form error

Some errors may occur at the highest level. For example, the server may be unable to process the submission.

In these cases, an infobox should be added at the top of the form to increase visibility. This alert should persist until the relevant errors are resolved.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Alert} />
</Canvas>

### Fieldset error

When multiple input selections are incompatible, the whole group may be made invalid.

In this case, an infobox should be inserted at the top of the fieldset. This alert should persist until all input errors are resolved.

See <a href="?path=/docs/mui-components-forms-fieldset--simple">Fieldset</a> for more information.

### Input error

Each input field within a form has its own error state that prevents a user from moving forward or completing a form.

See <a href="http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/mui-components-forms-textfield--default">TextField</a> for more information.

### Fieldsets

In addition to individual fields, forms support fieldsets as children. This allows you to group related fields together.

Fieldsets should be labeled by a legend. They can also include descriptions.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Fieldsets} />
</Canvas>

### The kitchen sink

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.KitchenSink} />
</Canvas>

## Best practices

### Length

In general, it is good for forms to be as simple and short as possible. Eliminating unnecessary fields will reduce user effort and translate to better completion rates.

### Layout

The form component is designed in a single-column layout to maintain a logical flow of completion.

Adding multiple columns in a form can generate confusion for users and lead to usability problems such as having more than one way to interpret the form and forcing users to reorient their eyes to different places in the form.
