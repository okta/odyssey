# Button

A clickable button used for form submissions and most in-page interactions.

## Behavior

Visually, a Button is a rounded rectangle with a descriptive caption at its center. Users interact with Buttons via both pointer devices and keystrokes.

## Variants

In Odyssey there are five Button variants: Primary, Secondary, Danger, and Floating.

### Primary

Use our default Button for primary actions in a view. For example, “Save”.

It's ideal to have one Primary Button per view. However, it's okay to have more than one Primary Button as long that they are equal in priority.

### Secondary

This is ideal for a secondary actions to compliment the Primary Button. Like the Primary Button, use this Button sparingly to provide focus to the user.

  <Story of={ButtonStories.ButtonSecondary} />

### Danger

Use Danger Buttons for scenarios where a user may be deleting information or making a decision that can not be reversed.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.ButtonDanger} />
</Canvas>

### Floating

Use Floating Buttons for interactions that change visible UI but don't submit data. For example, showing a password field or dismissing a modal.

They pair well with Primary and Secondary Buttons.

## Sizes

We offer three sizes of Buttons for use: Small, Medium, and Large. Full-width buttons are also available.

In order to provide a sufficient click area, all Button labels have a minimum width equal to twice the line-height.

### Small

Small Buttons are best used for actions within Table rows. Their font-size is descreased while keeping padding proportional to our medium size.

### Medium

Our default size, medium Buttons are built for use in most contexts.

  <Story of={ButtonStories.ButtonMedium} />

### Large

Large Buttons incease their padding, but not their font size. They're intended for single-interaction UIs like logging in.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.ButtonLarge} />
</Canvas>

### Full-width

Full-width Buttons are intended for single-interaction UIs. These are often widgets like "Sign In" or "Sign Up".

Use this variant when you desire the Button to be full-width regardless of screen size.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.ButtonFullWidth} />
</Canvas>

## States

Odyssey provides visual affordances these states: Enabled, Focus, Hover, and Disabled.

### Disabled

Disabled Buttons are unavailable for interaction and cannot be focused. They can be used when an action is unavailable, possibly due to incomplete information or access restrictions.

You should pair Disabled Buttons with a Tooltip if the user would benefit from additional context.

  <Story of={ButtonStories.ButtonPrimaryDisabled} />
