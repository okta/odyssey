# Status

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Success} />
</Canvas>

## Behavior

Status is not an interactive element. It is only intended to inform. If a Status indicates that a user should take action, be sure to provide the appropriate controls.

## Variants

There are four variants of Status available: Default, Success, Caution, and Danger.

### Default

Default statuses are gray and should be used to indicate states like "Paused", "Not started", or "Queued".

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Default} />
</Canvas>

### Success

Success statuses are green and should be used to indicate states like "Complete", "Active", or "Service operational".

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Success} />
</Canvas>

### Warning

Warning statuses are yellow and should be used to indicate states like "Attention suggested" or "Service degradation".

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Warning} />
</Canvas>

### Error

Error statuses are red and should be used to indicate states like "Error", "Failure", or "Service disruption".

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Error} />
</Canvas>

## Usage

Use Status to communicate the state of a discrete item, such as a server or individual process. Both labeled and unlabeled variants are acceptable, but should follow the associated guidelines.

### Within Table

Table supports Status as a content type. Status requires a distinct column and should not be mixed with other content types.

## Content guidelines

Statuses content should provide a quick overview. Limit Status descriptor and label text to three words or less. Use sentence casing for both.
