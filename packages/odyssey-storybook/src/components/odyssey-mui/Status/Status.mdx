# Status

## Behavior

Status is not an interactive element. It is only intended to inform. If a Status indicates that a user should take action, be sure to provide the appropriate controls.

## States

There are four states of Status available: Default, Success, Caution, and Danger. Each of these states is available in two indicator styles: **lamp** and **pill**.

### Default

Default statuses are gray and should be used to indicate states like "Paused", "Not started", or "Queued".

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.DefaultLamp} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.DefaultPill} />
</Canvas>

### Success

Success statuses are green and should be used to indicate states like "Complete", "Active", or "Service operational".

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.SuccessLamp} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.SuccessPill} />
</Canvas>

### Warning

Warning statuses are yellow and should be used to indicate states like "Attention suggested" or "Service degradation".

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.WarningLamp} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.WarningPill} />
</Canvas>

### Error

Error statuses are red and should be used to indicate states like "Error", "Failure", or "Service disruption".

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.ErrorLamp} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.ErrorPill} />
</Canvas>

## Usage

Use Status to communicate the state of a discrete item, such as a server or individual process. Both labeled and unlabeled variants are acceptable, but should follow the associated guidelines.

### Within Table

Table supports Status as a content type. Status requires a distinct column and should not be mixed with other content types.

## Content guidelines

Statuses content should provide a quick overview. Limit Status descriptor and label text to three words or less. Use sentence casing for both.
