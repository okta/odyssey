# Text Input

Text inputs allow users to edit and input data. They can range from simple search boxes to long-form text areas.

## Anatomy

**ANATOMY MISSING**

## Variants

### Default

This default serves as the basis for our Text Inputs. A shown here, they required paired with a paired Label.

<Story id="components-textinput--text"/>

### Search

Standalone Search provides minimal UI for searching outside of normal form contexts. Search inputs will render with the "Search" UI indicator as well as a visually hidden label.

In this case, we recommend using the placeholder attribute to state the scope of your search. This text should match the hidden label.

<Story id="components-textinput--search"/>

#### Button variant

We also provide an attached button for in-page searching or avoiding placeholder text. Please follow our [Button guidelines](/components/button) when using these variants.

### Textarea

Textareas should be used for multi-line text inputs. As the user types the field will grow vertically to accommodate the new lines.

**STORY MISSING**

## States

Text inputs support the following states: enabled, hover, focus, disabled, read-only, optional, and invalid.

### Enabled

Text inputs in their "normal" state are considered enabled. They are ready for user interaction.

**STORY MISSING**

### Hover

Hover states are activated when the user pauses their pointer over the input.

**STORY MISSING**

### Focus

The focus state is a visual affordance that the user has highlighted the input with a pointer, keyboard, or voice.

**STORY MISSING**

### Disabled

Disabled inputs are unavailable for interaction and cannot be focused. They can be used when input is disallowed, possibly due to a system state or access restrictions.

The values of disabled inputs will not be submitted.

**STORY MISSING**

### Read-only

Similar to disabled inputs, users cannot modify the values of read-only inputs. However, users can otherwise interact with read-only inputs and select their values for copying.

This state can be helpful when displaying computed or third-party values, or when a submitted form is being processed.

The values of read-only inputs will be submitted.

**STORY MISSING**

### Optional

Odyssey assumes inputs are required by default. Optional inputs should be used to indicate when data is not required for the user to complete a task.

**STORY MISSING**

### Invalid

The invalid state is for inputs with incorrect values or values of the wrong format.

When indicating a validation error, please use a Field Error label to indicate the nature of the error. Color alone is not an accessible way to signify that something has gone wrong.

## Content Guidelines

Text inputs support most free-form content, but we offer specific support for email, telephone numbers, and passwords.

### Email

There are no specific UI changes for email addresses, but inputs of this type will validate that the address is properly formatted.

**STORY MISSING**

### Tel

Unlike email fields, tel inputs are not automatically validated because global formats are so varied.

**STORY MISSING**

### Password

Passwords inputs ensure that sensitive content is safely obscured.

**STORY MISSING**

## Accessibility

### Placeholders

Except for Search inputs, we advise against using placeholder text for inputs.

### Purpose

When collecting an individual's personal data, you must define the input's purpose via the `autocomplete` attribute. This allows users to automate the filling of fields and ensures the purpose is known, regardless of the label. A complete list of fields this is required for may be found <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes">in the WCAG spec</a>.

#### Translation

To prevent triggering a change in page layout, browsers don't translate certain attributes. Because of this, users will see untranslated placeholder text.

#### Recall

Placeholder text disappears when a field is interacted with. For this reason, it's not suitable for formatting guidelines or necessary context.

#### Utility

Placeholder content is limited to static text. Additionally, placeholder text is truncated beyond the width of its input.

#### Field value confusion

Low-contrast placeholders may be illegible for some users. Yet, placeholders with compliant contrast can be mistaken for field values. High Contrast Mode will make placeholders and values appear identical.

Finally, Users with low digital literacy may not understand the purpose or behavior of placeholder text.
