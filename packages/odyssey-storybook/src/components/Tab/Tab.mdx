# Tab

Navigation component used to organize content by grouping similar information on the same page. They allow content to be viewed without having to navigate away from that page or route.

## Anatomy

**STORY MISSING**

## Behavior

Users interact with Tab as they would a button, the main difference is the outcome. By default, the first tab is active and the associated content displayed in the tab panel. Upon selecting a different tab, the tab indicator appears on the selected tab. The tab panel will then update to show the new content.

Additionally, the tab element is keyboard-navigable (See [Accessibility: Keyboard Support](#keyboard-support))

## Usage

Tabs were created to shorten long pages. Before you use these, we’d recommend laying
out all of the content on your page out first. From there, figure out common themes and
see what could be grouped together. Those themes should become your Tabs.

### Relate to the page title

Tabs are not navigation. Meaning they don’t take you from place to place. Rather, they are meant for context switching related to the page.

### Position above major content

Tabs are best used at the top of the page or situated above the content it’s related to. This will help establish hierarchy.

### Don't stack tabs

Use Tab sparingly. Limit the Tab component to one per page, and refrain from including a second set of Tabs within a tabpanel.

## Content Guidelines

- Refrain from using tabs without tabpanels.
- Don't have more than 8 tabs in a tablist.
- Don't add an icon to a tab. Icons should be reserved for very specific things. It can be hard to maintain consistency with use of icons as it pertains to their semantic meanings and meaning to Okta.

      When implementing this component you should consider the following
      keyboard behaviors.

          Unlike the right arrow key, if you tab past the last element, the tab
          focus continues down the page as normal. In this case, it should set
          focus in to the active <code>tabpanel</code>
