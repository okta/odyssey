# Status

Status is used to inform users by providing feedback on system states. Status can display broad operational states as well as granular states like user status.

## Behavior

Status is not an interactive element. It is only intended to inform. If a Status indicates that a user should take action, be sure to provide the appropriate controls.

## Variants

There are four variants of Status available: Neutral, Success, Caution, and Danger.

### Neutral

Neutral Statuses are gray and should be used to indicate states like "Paused", "Not started", or "Queued".

This is the default variant.

### Within Table

Table supports Status as a content type. Status requires a distinct column and should not be mixed with other content types.

In this case the column heading acts as the Status label.

## Content guidelines

Statuses content should provide a quick overview. Limit Status descriptor and label text to three words or less. Use sentence casing for both.

### Statuses without labels

Where necessary, labels may be hidden. If a label is not present, ensure the Status copy communicates appropriate context. Even if the label is hidden, it must be populated to ensure context for users of assistive technology.
