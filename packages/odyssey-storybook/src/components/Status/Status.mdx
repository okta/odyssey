# Status

Status is used to inform users by providing feedback on system states. Status can display broad operational states as well as granular states like user status.

## Anatomy

**ANATOMY MISSING**

## Behavior

Status is not an interactive element. It is only intended to inform. If a Status indicates that a user should take action, be sure to provide the appropriate controls.

## Variants

There are four variants of Status available: Neutral, Success, Caution, and Danger.

### Neutral

Neutral Statuses are gray and should be used to indicate states like "Paused", "Not started", or "Queued".

This is the default variant.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-status--neutral" />
</Canvas>

### Success

Success Statuses are green and should be used to indicate states like "Complete", "Active", or "Service operational".

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-status--success" />
</Canvas>

### Caution

Caution Statuses are yellow and should be used to indicate states like "Attention suggested" or "Service degradation".

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-status--caution" />
</Canvas>

### Danger

Danger Statuses are red and should be used to indicate states like "Error", "Failure", or "Service disruption".

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-status--danger" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

Use Status to communicate the state of a discrete item, such as a server or individual process. Both labeled and unlabeled variants are acceptable, but should follow the associated guidelines.

**STORY MISSING**

### Within Table

Table supports Status as a content type. Status requires a distinct column and should not be mixed with other content types.

In this case the column heading acts as the Status label.

## Content guidelines

Statuses content should provide a quick overview. Limit Status descriptor and label text to three words or less. Use sentence casing for both.

**STORY MISSING**

### Statuses without labels

Where necessary, labels may be hidden. If a label is not present, ensure the Status copy communicates appropriate context. Even if the label is hidden, it must be populated to ensure context for users of assistive technology.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-status--with-label-hidden" />
</Canvas>
