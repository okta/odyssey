## Behavior (optional)

Landing Gear deploys through doors in the heat shield. This component cannot be retracted once deployed.

## Variants (optional)

Odyssey offers both automatic and manual variants of Landing Gear.

### Manual

Since Landing Gear is deployed through the heat shield, our default variant is Manual control. Unless automated systems have a sufficient success rate, please utilize this variant.

### Automatic

Automatic Landing Gear is deployed once the orbiter has achieved a set proximity to the ground. If your atmospheric density is variable, we recommend using Manual deployment instead.

## States (optional)

### Retracted

In its retracted state, Landing Gear is not visible, being stored behind the heat shield.

### Deployed

In its deployed state, Landing Gear emerges from behind the heat shield and becomes visible. Landings are only possible in this state.

## Usage

Landing Gear should be used when designing any craft with air-to-ground capability.

For most crafts, three sets of Landing Gear are necessary and sufficient. If you are working with particularly large or small crafts, please reach out to the Odyssey team.

### Do

- Utilize Landing Gear when terrestial excursions are rare but expected.
- Account for both retracted and deployed states in your designs.

### Don't

- Landing Gear should not be included on any craft that will not make terrestial landings.
- Do not limit your craft to only Deployed or Retracted states. Landing Gear requires both states for full functionality.

## Content Guidelines

When marking left and right Landing Gear controls, treat the nose of your craft as "forward".

Please do not use "port" and "starboard" terminology when referencing controls, as these designations are not useful on some planets.

## Accessibility

Crafts utilizing Landing Gear are required to utilize a nose wheel steering system. Ensure your individual Landing Gear components are associated with the appropriate rudder pedals.

## Responsive Web Design (optional)

As noted above, craft are expected to utilize three sets of Landing Gear. This configuration should scale for both large and small crafts.

If you encounter issues with the configuration, please reach out, as a more fluid design may be required.

## Globalization (optional)

Some systems disallow Automatic variants of Landing Gear, as failures are catastrophic. Ensure your craft designs are in compliance with local mandates.
