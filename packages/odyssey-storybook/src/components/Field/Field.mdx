# Field

Field provides all of the supporting context required by inputs, including labels, hints, and errors.

This component also helps ensure proper accessibility by managing `aria-` attributes and `id` associations between inputs and their associated elements.

## Anatomy

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-textinput--kitchen-sink" />
</Canvas>

### Label

A text label for the Field. The associated element may be `<label>` or `<legend>` depending on Field's Input type.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-field--field-label" />
</Canvas>

The label also indicates the Field's optional/required status to ensure screen readers properly announce the state.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-field--field-optional" />
</Canvas>

### Hint

A hint is helper text for the Field. They offer better accessibility and usability than the `placeholder` attribute. Hints should provide any necessary help text for their Field but are optional.

Appropriate examples include expected formatting or value types.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-field--field-hint" />
</Canvas>

### Error

Inline error messaging for the Field.

All errors require a visible or SR-only "Error:" label. This labeling is not handled automatically and must be included in the error message.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-field--field-error" />
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable />

<ThemeTable componentThemeReducer={theme} />

## Variants

While their appearance is identical, Field supports single and grouped inputs by offering an `as=" foo"` polymorphic API.

### Single Input

Fields for lone inputs are rendered as `div`s and assign their `label`/`input` relationship using an ID.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-textarea--default" />
</Canvas>

### Grouped Inputs

Fields for grouped inputs are rendered as `fieldset`s, using a `legend` to label all of the associated `input`s accessibly. This variant also spreads hint and error associations across affected controls.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-radio--default" />
</Canvas>

## States

Fields may be either required or optional, depending on what's called for by their input.

### Required

By default, inputs and Fields are set to `required`. As the default, this state has no unique affordance.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-textinput--text" />
</Canvas>

### Optional

In order to mark a Field as optional, set `required` to `false` and include an `opationalLabel`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-textinput--optional" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

Field is a complementary component, providing shared structure across Odyssey Inputs like [Text Input](?path=/docs/components-textinput--text#text-input).

When assembling Forms, it's unnecessary to utilize Field, as it's built into Odyssey's Inputs already.

If you are building a new or bespoke Input component, please utilize Field to ensure consistent behavior with existing components.

## Content Guidelines

### Labels

A well-written label describes the purpose of the Field for the user.

Use concise, descriptive labels (a word or two) to help users quickly scan your form.

"Destination" rather than "Please enter your destination".

Finally, please use sentence casing for your labels. Sentence case is easier to read and will help reduce error rates and speed up form completion time.

"Landing gear deployment speed" rather than "Landing Gear Deployment Speed"

### Hints

When writing hints, only provide information that assists with the immediate task.

For example, "The expected format is `YYYY-MM-DD`."

Hints like, "This information will be used to do x, y, and z." may be informative without assisting the user in completing their form.

If additional disclosures or warnings are required, an [Infobox](?path=/docs/components-infobox--info#infobox) may be more appropriate.

Remember: a good label may eliminate the need for a hint.

### Errors

At minimum, error messages should explain why an entry is invalid. Great error messages also note how the user can address the problem.

For example, "This value is invalid." is less helpful than "This field requires a complete email address."

If the user cannot fix the error or if the error extends beyond the Field, it should instead be surfaced at the Field Group, Form, or page level.

## Accessibility

Field does its best to correctly associate attributes and place `aria-` tags where necessary. For input-specific accessibility concerns, please refer to the relevant component's documentation.

Your error messages should include an "Error:" label, whether visible or visually hidden.

## Globalization

To support ease of localization, Field's `optionalLabel` string has no default and must be supplied by the user.

Similarly, an "Error:" label is not automatically inserted into Field error messages.
