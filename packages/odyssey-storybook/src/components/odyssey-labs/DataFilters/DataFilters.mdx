`DataFilters` were created as part of `DataTable` but have been decoupled so we can use this pattern
anywhere that filters are necessary.

It features a unified UI for filters and search, and provides callbacks so consumers can bring their own
logic.

When filters are set, they are displayed as chips underneath the filter/search row, and can be cleared via
a "Clear all" button.

## Filters

Exposing the Filters UI requires two props to be set: `filters` and `onChangeFilters`.

`filters` should be an array of `DataFilter` objects, defined as such:

```tsx
type DataFilter = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  variant?: (typeof dataFilterVariantValues)[number];
  value?: string | string[] | undefined;
  options?: Array<{ label: string; value: string }>;
};
```

A `DataFilter` is of type `text` by default, but can be set to any of the following:

- `autocomplete`
- `checkbox`
- `date`
- `date-range`
- `multi-select`
- `range`
- `range-slider`
- `select`
- `text`

The filtering UI for each of these adapts to the variant, though currently only a few variants have
their own UI: `text`, `checkbox`, `multi-select`, and `select`. Any other variant will have a missing input
for now.

A typical usage of `onChangeFilters` would be to set the parent component's state to the return value,
or perform an effect whenever the return value changes. In the case of `DataTable`, it fires the `fetchDataFn` whenever
the filters change.

## Search

The filtering UI is only visible if `filters` is defined. If `filters` is undefined and `onChangeSearch` is defined,
the search UI will be displayed without accompanying filters.

By default, `onChangeSearch` fires whenever the user changes the input value, debounced by 200ms. You can change the debounce
by setting a different number of milliseconds in `searchDelay`. Or, you can force `onChangeSearch` to only fire on submit by setting
`searchOnSubmit` to `true`.

## Additional actions

`DataFilters` provides a slot for additional actions by passing a `ReactNode` into `additionalActions`. This is intended exclusively for
`<Button>` and `<MenuButton>` components, which will be displayed in the same row as the filters and serach, but aligned right.

`DataTable` uses this to expose density and column visibility controls.
