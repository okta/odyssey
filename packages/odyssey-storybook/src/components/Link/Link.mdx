# Link

Links are navigation elements displayed as text. Use a Link to bring a user to another page or start a download.

## Anatomy

**ANATOMY MISSING**

## Variants

### External links

External links open in a separate tab and are identified by the <span class="sample--external-link-icon" aria-label="External link icon"></span> icon appended to the link.

Use an external link when:

- The destination of the link aids in the completion of a task on the current tab (e.g. help documentation)
- Opening the link in the current tab would result in loss of data or task interruption (e.g. completing a long form)

<Story id="components-link--external"/>

## States

### Visited Links

Odyssey disables special styling for visited links. This is an intentional compromise that preferences user security and ease of maintenance.

## Usage

Links may be used within content or as standalone UI. When using links within content - like a paragraph or list item - do not pair them with Icons.

Avoid using Links for actions, preferring Buttons instead.

## Content guidelines

Choose Link copy that describes the destination (e.g. "Settings"), rather than generic text (e.g. "Click here" or a URL). Aim to keep this copy concise, three words at most.

Keep in mind that all users may not have the same visual context due to their device or other constraints.

### Icons

Icons may be included in standalone links. They are not supported within paragraph content or longer copy.

Icon layout is automatic, based on language direction.

<Story id="components-link--with-icon"/>

### Mailto

If you need a direct email link, display the whole address (e.g. lauren.ipsum@okta.com).

Avoid colloquial text that hides the associated email (e.g. "Contact Us").

### Accessibility

Links in Odyssey are not underlined. They maintain a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio with our body text colors and a 4.5:1 ratio with our available background colors. If you deviate from these standards via overrides, ensure that your links have a non-color indicator like an underline.

Links should display a visible affordance when users interact via keyboard. Odyssey preserves the default `:focus` state for each browser.
