# Typography

A set of pre-defined text styles for headers, body copy, and links designed for readability and clarity of hierarchy.

## Hierarchy

<Description>

Typographical hierarchy indicates importance of content. Through size and weight, a strong hierarchy can provide clarity to a user to easily understand which level of the content they’re on. Sections need subsections, and those subsections may also need their own subsections. Visually, a user should be able to clearly tell a parent section from a child section simply by the relationship in size and weight between headings.

## Type styles

<Description>

To ensure consistency in typography sizes throughout Okta touchpoints, we’ve created a custom type scale paired with appropriate weights and line-heights.

### Headings

<Description>

Headings are used to describe the main idea of a page, a section, or content that follows it. By default, header tags (`h1` through `h6`) use the corresponding title size.
