# Philosophy and Guiding Principles

## Vision

Become the standard Okta UI framework powering teams and customers to create more consistent, efficient, usable and accessible experiences.

## Principles at a glance

1. Modular
2. Minimal
3. Accessible
4. Functional

## Principles

### Modular

- Components can be used in isolation without any required setup or surrounding context in the browser at run time.
- Components ship with embedded, low specificity styles that will not affect other UI on the page incorrectly.
- Components are designed with an open API that provides consumers with direct access to the underlying DOM node via forwarded refs.
- Just as DOM nodes are composable, so are DOM event handlers; consumers should be able to pass their own event handlers directly to a component and stop internal handlers from firing.
- Components are built using composition of low level components which can also be leverged by consumers for their own higher order components.

### Minimal

- Most Components ship with zero third party dependencies beyond React itself.
- Components are published in an ESM format to allow for optimizied bundling and polyfilling by consumers.

### Accessible

- Components adhere to WCAG 2.2 AA success criteria and WAI-ARIA guidelines.
- Developers should know about accessibility but shouldn't have to spend too much time implementing accessible patterns.
- Most behavior and markup related to accessibility should be abstracted, and bits that can't should be simplified where possible.
- Individual components are tested to ensure accessibility, but where app context is required the component library should provide useful guidance to support building fully accessible applications.

### Functional

- Components are feature-rich, with support for keyboard interaction, responsive layouts, multiple variants and more.
- Low level components expose utility styling APIs to help with building UI without writing or maintaining any CSS by hand.
- Components are built to be themed; no need to override opinionated styles using error prone cascade approaches that are tightly coupled to internal DOM structure.

## Other considerations

### Internationalization

- Components support injecting internationalized user facing strings and make behavioral and layout adjustments for right-to-left languages.

### Stateful components can be controlled or uncontrolled

- Similar to form field JSX elements in React, all components with internal state can either be uncontrolled (internally managed) or controlled (managed by the consumer).

### Developer experience

- Component APIs are designed to be consistent, resiliant, unambiguous, simple, and tiny.
- Component APIs favor a declarative approach when possible.
- Components ship with supporting type annotations for props and static members for compound components.

### Misc

- Code should be easy to reason about
- Code should be easy to delete
- Avoid early abstractions
- Avoid thinking too far into the future
- Complexity should be introduced when it is inevitable
- Keep file structure flat so logic is easier to follow.
- Don't repeat yourself _too much_ but don't be afraid to repeat yourself if an implementation detail hasn't been thoroughly vetted.
