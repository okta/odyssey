# Docs Status

This document serves as a scratch pad for the ongoing docs migration effort.

**"Current Status"** provides a glimpse-friendly look at where the migration effort is at.

**"General Items"** section below applies to either all stories or Storybook generally.

**"Components"** section lists special considerations specific to each story. More often than not, this will entail missing or mismatched stories.

## Current Status

Docs content has been migrated as-is and is undergoing an audit for parity and quality.

This document will be kept up to date as this effort progresses.

## General Items

### Missing

- Component Anatomy is missing throughout
- Examples that require generative CSS no longer work (see: Colors, Typography)
- Examples that require global CSS no longer work (See: Elements)
- SB styles differ from Odyssey styles in ways that may cause confusion

#### Components

The following components are missing documentation:

- Circular Load Indicator
- Field
- Field Group
- Form
- Heading
- Icon
- List
- Screen Reader Text
- Text Area (previously with Text Input)

#### Supporting Content

The following supporting content has not been migrated:

- Updates
- Help
- Figma link

### Open Questions

- What should the default tab be? What should that behavior look like? Test `viewMode: 'docs'`
- Are there any args, per component, that we want to hide from ArgsTable?
- How do we best document browser states like `:hover` for the user?
  - Should these require interaction?
  - What about `:disabled`?

## Components

### Banner

#### Stories

The existing Banner stories don't make distinctions regarding the optional and mandatory elements, so all stories currently include all features.

**Recommendation:** Rewrite existing stories to showcase minimal features with additional stories showcasing Title, Dismiss, and Actions.

##### Existing

- Info
- Danger
- Caution
- Dismissible (identical to Info)

##### Assumed

###### Variants

- Info
- Danger
- Caution

###### Features

- Title
- Actions
- Dismissible

### Button

#### Stories

We are missing browser-state stories for Button (e.g. `:hover`, `:focus`, `:disabled`).

- Should these examples be provided in the docs for each component with browser states?
- Are these stories? Something else?

We're missing stories for Good/Bad usage examples as well as content-specific examples (e.g. capitalization, word choice).

### Checkbox

#### Stories

- Checkbox stories always include error text, which is styled incorrectly.
- Similar issue with Button re: browser state examples.
- Checkbox stories default to invalid due to styling.

### Field

The docs for Field have been migrated over from Field Label. Field, FieldGroup, and Form all need net new documentation.

This older deployment offers a starting point: https://9d6b542.ods.dev/components/form/

### Icon

Previously, Icon was not a component, so those "guideline" docs have not been migrated.

### Callout

#### Stories

Similar to Banner, Callout stories surface all options up front, with no visual examples for optional components like Actions. Nor do they surface alternate approaches for Actions (inline action vs actions section).

We're also missing examples for content guidelines.

### Link

#### Documentation

We're missing documentation for the Secondary link variant.

#### Stories

As above, we're missing examples for content guidelines and content variants (like mailto).

### Modal

#### Stories

The existing Modal story doesn't surface any controls and defaults to open - making them unusable for docs.

### Radio

#### Stories

Like Checkbox, our Radios default to an invalid state since they're required and relying on browser validation.

We're also missing stateful stories as above.

### Select

- The Select ArgsTable doesn't display any inputs.

#### Stories

- Stateful stories missing
- Invalid story missing
- Usage specific example missing
- Group story not documented
- Controlled story not documented

### Status

#### Stories

- Missing usage example
- Missing content example

### Tab

- ArgsTable is showing no inputs

#### Stories

- Tabs are missing all Do/Don't examples

### Table

The large content types example relies on a ton of bespoke styling.

#### Stories

- Default Table is a sorted table, not a plain Table
- Empty Table has incorrect styling
- Missing Row Heading story
- Missing large content types example

### Tag

#### Stories

- Do/Don't examples are missing

### Text Input

#### Stories

Text Input is missing stories for all browser states, as well as stories for alternate `type`s like `email`.

We're also missing stories for variants like "Input with Button".

### Toast

Overall, Toast stories are not built for example use cases.

Likely, we will want to deviate from our previous behavior, instead showcasing pre-rendered Toasts on-page, instead of requiring a button-press for all examples.

However, the provider story may benefit from being rewritten to allow for a more docs-friendly display.

### Tooltip

#### Stories

Tooltip currently provides a single story that surfaces all possible positioning. This precludes us from using that story as a baseline for Context or Do/Don't examples - or even showcasing an individual example of Tooltipped element.
