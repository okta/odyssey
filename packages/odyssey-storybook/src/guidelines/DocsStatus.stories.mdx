# Docs Status

This document serves as a scratch pad for the docs migration effort.

"Current Status" provides a glimpse-friendly look at where the migration effort is at.

The "General Items" section below applies to either all stories or Storybook generally.

The "Components" section lists special considerations specific to each story. More often than not, this will entail missing or mismatched stories.

Regarding stories: the "Existing" headings inventory those stories that exist in SB today, along with any caveats. "Assumed" inventories the stories assumed by the previous docs.

## Current Status

Docs content has been migrated as-is and is undergoing an audit for parity and quality.

The result of this audit will be an inventory of items to discuss that can be turned into discrete, actionable tickets.

## General Items

### Missing

- Component Anatomy is missing throughout.
- Mismatch between SB typography and React typography.
- All Component docs pages should surface an ArgsTable
  - Are there any args, per component, that we want to hide?

#### Components

The following components are missing documentation:

- Circular Load Indicator
- Field
- Field Group
- Form
- Heading
- Icon
- List
- Screen Reader Text
- Text Area (previously with Text Input

#### Guidelines

The following guidelines have not been migrated:

- Color
- Design Tokens
- Elements
- Typography
- Iconography
- Updates
- Help
- Figma link

### Broken

- Links need to be rewritten throughout.

### Open Questions

- How do we want to style internal reference tables? Using `<table>` for SB styling? Using `Table` for React dogfood?
- How do we author stories for Bad Examples?
- Should we have stories for all available optional-part combinations?
  - If not, what do we document and test visually?
- What should the default tab be? What should that behavior look like? Test `viewMode: 'docs'`
- Story style is inconsistent between example content and descriptive content. Rec: example content
- How do we best document browser states like `:hover` for the user?
  - Should these require interaction?
  - What about `:disabled`?
- Related, how do we best document stories re: grammar or word choice?
- How should we order content sections?

## Components

### Banner

#### Stories

The existing Banner stories don't make distinctions regarding the optional and mandatory elements, so all stories currently include all features.

**Recommendation:** Rewrite existing stories to showcase minimal features with additional stories showcasing Title, Dismiss, and Actions.

##### Existing

- Info
- Danger
- Caution
- Dismissable (identical to Info)

##### Assumed

###### Variants

- Info
- Danger
- Caution

###### Features

- Title
- Actions
- Dismissable

### Button

#### Stories

We are missing browser-state stories for Button (e.g. `:hover`, `:focus`, `:disabled`).

- Should these examples be provided in the docs for each component with browser states?
- Are these stories? Something else?

We're missing stories for Good/Bad usage examples as well as content-specific examples (e.g. capitalization, word choice).

### Checkbox

#### Stories

- Checkbox stories always include error text, which is styled incorrectly.
- Similar issue with Button re: browser state examples.
- Checkbox stories default to invalid due to styling.

### Field

The docs for Field have been migrated over from Field Label. Field, FieldGroup, and Form all need net new documentation.

This older deployment offers a starting point: https://9d6b542.ods.dev/components/form/

### Icon

Previously, Icon was not a component, so those "guideline" docs have not been migrated.

### Infobox

#### Stories

Similar to Banner, Infobox stories surface all options up front, with no visual examples for optional components like Actions. Nor do they surface alternate approaches for Actions (inline action vs actions section).

We're also missing examples for content guidelines.

### Link

#### Documentation

We're missing documentation for the Secondary link variant.

#### Stories

As above, we're missing examples for content guidelines and content variants (like mailto).

### Modal

#### Stories

The existing Modal story doesn't surface any controls and defaults to open - making them unusable for docs.

### Radio

#### Stories

Like Checkbox, our Radios default to an invalid state since they're required and relying on browser validation.

We're also missing stateful stories as above.
