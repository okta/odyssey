# Docs Status

This document serves as a scratch pad for the docs migration effort.

"Current Status" provides a glimpse-friendly look at where the migration effort is at.

The "General Items" section below applies to either all stories or Storybook generally.

The "Components" section lists special considerations specific to each story. More often than not, this will entail missing or mismatched stories.

Regarding stories: the "Existing" headings inventory those stories that exist in SB today, along with any caveats. "Assumed" inventories the stories assumed by the previous docs.

## Current Status

Docs content has been migrated as-is and is undergoing an audit for parity and quality.

The result of this audit will be an inventory of items to discuss that can be turned into discrete, actionable tickets.

## General Items

### Missing

- Component Anatomy is missing throughout.
- Mismatch between SB typography and React typography.
- All Component docs pages should surface an ArgsTable
  - Are there any args, per component, that we want to hide?

### Broken

- Links need to be rewritten throughout.

### Open Questions

- How do we want to style internal reference tables? Using `<table>` for SB styling? Using `Table` for React dogfood?
- How do we author stories for Bad Examples?
- Should we have stories for all available optional-part combinations?
  - If not, what do we document and test visually?

## Components

### Banner

#### Stories

The existing Banner stories don't make distinctions regarding the optional and mandatory elements, so all stories currently include all features.

**Recommendation:** Rewrite existing stories to showcase minimal features with additional stories showcasing Title, Dismiss, and Actions.

##### Existing

- Info
- Danger
- Caution
- Dismissable (identical to Info)

##### Assumed

###### Variants

- Info
- Danger
- Caution

###### Features

- Title
- Actions
- Dismissable
